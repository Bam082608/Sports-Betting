# 🚨 EMERGENCY PROTOCOL: STOP THE BLEEDING

**Version:** 1.0  
**Effective Date:** December 2, 2025  
**Status:** ACTIVE  
**Owner:** William (Project Lead Bam082608)  
**Review Date:** When bankroll reaches $650 OR after 14 days (whichever comes first)

---

## ⚠️ ACTIVATION CRITERIA

This protocol activates when ANY of the following conditions are met:

- ✅ **Bankroll declines >10% from recent peak** (Currently: $680 → $582 = -14.4%)  
- ✅ **3+ consecutive losing days**  
- ✅ **Emotional decision-making detected** ("need to win it back" thoughts)  
- ✅ **Protocol violations in last 7 days** (unverified bets, parlay overuse)  
- ✅ **Unclear attribution of losses** (can't identify which sport/bet type is bleeding)

**Current Status:** ✅ ACTIVATED (Dec 2, 2025)  
**Reason:** Bankroll down 14.4%, 3-4 day losing streak, suspected NFL losses

---

## 🎯 MISSION OBJECTIVE

**Primary Goal:** Stop bankroll decline and stabilize at current level ($582)  
**Secondary Goal:** Rebuild confidence through small, consistent wins  
**Exit Target:** Bankroll recovers to $650 (11.7% gain) OR 10-day positive streak

**Success Metrics:**  
- 7 days without bankroll decline below $582  
- 70%+ win rate on executed bets  
- Zero protocol violations  
- Zero emotional/tilt bets

---

## 📋 THE 7 COMMANDMENTS

### **RULE 1: NFL MORATORIUM** ⛔

**What:** ZERO NFL bets until protocol deactivation  
**Why:** "A lot of them are football" + NFL has longer feedback loops + less frequent games = harder to identify edge  
**Duration:** Minimum 7 days OR until bankroll hits $650  

**Exceptions:** NONE  
- ❌ "But I have a great read on this game"  
- ❌ "Monday Night Football is different"  
- ❌ "Just one small bet"  
- ❌ "Playoff implications make this +EV"

**Violation Penalty:** Automatic 48-hour betting pause (all sports)

---

### **RULE 2: NHL FOUNDATION ONLY** ✅

**What:** Only bet Tier 1 verified APEXVIPER foundation plays  
**Who:** Players with 5+ SOG per game averages (verified current season)  
**What Props:** 2+ SOG props ONLY (no period splits, no game totals, no goalies)

**Approved Player List (Tier 1 Foundation):**  
- Jason Robertson (DAL) - 5.13 SOG/game  
- Roope Hintz (DAL) - 4.85 SOG/game  
- Connor Bedard (CHI) - 5.04 SOG/game  
- Cutter Gauthier (ANA) - 4.26 SOG/game  
- Rasmus Dahlin (BUF) - 4.12 SOG/game  
- *Add only after verification: 5+ SOG/gm average current season*

**Forbidden Bet Types (During Emergency Protocol):**  
- ❌ Period-specific props (2P, 3P, 2P+3P)  
- ❌ Game totals (Over/Under team totals)  
- ❌ Goalie save props  
- ❌ Moneylines  
- ❌ Puck lines  
- ❌ Experimental theories (untested correlations)

**Rationale:** 2+ SOG props have highest hit rate for elite shooters. Simplify to foundation edge only.

---

### **RULE 3: UNIT SIZE REDUCTION** 📉

**Current Bankroll:** $582  
**Emergency Unit:** 1.5% = $8.73 (round to $8.75 for simplicity)

**Bet Sizing Rules:**  
- **Maximum per bet:** $5.00 (0.86% of bankroll)  
- **Maximum per slate:** $15.00 total exposure (2.6% of bankroll)  
- **Recommended bets per slate:** 3-5 bets maximum

**Example Slate Structure:**  
```
Game 1: Robertson 2+ SOG - $5.00  
Game 2: Hintz 2+ SOG - $5.00  
Game 3: Bedard 2+ SOG - $5.00  
TOTAL: $15.00 (within limits)
```

**Forbidden:**  
- ❌ "Just $10 on this one, it's a lock"  
- ❌ "Doubling unit size to win back yesterday"  
- ❌ "This is only $7, not $15"

**Unit size increases ONLY when:**  
- Bankroll reaches $650+ (reset to 2% units)  
- 10+ day positive streak  
- Explicit protocol revision approved

---

### **RULE 4: ZERO PARLAYS** 🚫

**What:** 100% straight bets only  
**Why:** Nov 24 case study showed $33.50 parlay loss would have been -$1.08 straight bets (97% damage reduction)

**Forbidden Structures:**  
- ❌ 2-leg parlays ("just combining my two best picks")  
- ❌ 3-leg+ parlays  
- ❌ "Small lottery tickets" ($0.25-$1.00 mega parlays)  
- ❌ Same-game parlays (even if "correlated")  
- ❌ "But the odds boost makes it +EV"

**What IS allowed:**  
- ✅ Single straight bets only  
- ✅ Each bet graded independently  
- ✅ Partial wins possible (3/5 bets can still profit)

**Parlay Privileges Resume ONLY When:**  
- Bankroll hits $650+ AND  
- 10-day positive streak AND  
- New parlay protocol written and approved

---

### **RULE 5: MANDATORY VERIFICATION** ✔️

**Timeline:**  
- **12:30 PM:** Initial lineup check (DailyFaceoff.com)  
- **6:00 PM:** Final goalie confirmation + starting lineup verification  
- **90 minutes before puck drop:** Confirm no late scratches

**Required Checks Before ANY Bet:**  
1. ✅ Verify player is in starting lineup (not healthy scratch)  
2. ✅ Verify player is not injured/GTD  
3. ✅ Verify starting goalie confirmed (if relevant to game environment)  
4. ✅ Check beat writer Twitter for late-breaking lineup changes  
5. ✅ Cross-reference two sources (DailyFaceoff + team Twitter)

**If Player Status = Questionable/GTD/Unconfirmed:**  
- **Action:** SKIP THE BET  
- **No exceptions:** "But he'll probably play" = SKIP

**Violation Example (Nov 24 "Florida Massacre"):**  
- Bet against Tampa assuming Kucherov OUT  
- Kucherov cleared at 12:07 PM (news missed)  
- Result: -$33.50 loss  
- **Lesson:** Verification saves money

**Mandatory Phone Alarm:**  
- Set recurring 12:30 PM and 6:00 PM alarms  
- Alarm label: "LINEUP CHECK - NO BETS WITHOUT VERIFICATION"

---

### **RULE 6: DAILY CHECKPOINT** 📊

**End of Day Assessment (11:00 PM after all games settled):**

**Question 1:** Did bankroll go UP or DOWN today?  
- If UP: Record win, continue protocol  
- If DOWN: Record loss, check streak length

**Question 2:** How many days in current streak?  
- If DOWN 2 days in a row → **TRIGGER 48-HOUR PAUSE**  
- If UP 3 days in a row → Consider unit size increase (10% max)

**48-Hour Pause Rules:**  
- ✅ No bets placed for 48 hours (full calendar days)  
- ✅ Use time to review system, read documentation  
- ✅ Reflect on violations (if any)  
- ✅ Return with fresh mindset

**Question 3:** Did I violate any of the 7 rules today?  
- If YES → Document violation, implement 24-hour pause  
- If NO → Continue protocol

**Tracking Format:**  
```
Date: 12/2/25  
Bets Placed: 3 (Robertson, Hintz, Bedard)  
Result: 2W-1L  
P&L: +$4.25  
Bankroll: $586.25 (+0.73%)  
Violations: None  
Streak: +1 day
```

---

### **RULE 7: NO TILT BETTING** 🧠

**Tilt Indicators (MUST pause if ANY detected):**  
- 🚩 Thinking "I need to win back yesterday's losses"  
- 🚩 Feeling angry at a player/team for "letting me down"  
- 🚩 Increasing bet sizes mid-slate because "this one's a lock"  
- 🚩 Betting on games you didn't research because "why not"  
- 🚩 Refreshing sportsbook repeatedly looking for "something to bet"  
- 🚩 Making bets within 30 minutes of a loss settling

**Tilt Test (Ask before EVERY bet):**  
> "Would I make this exact bet if my bankroll was $1,000 and I was on a 10-day winning streak?"

- If YES → Bet is rational  
- If NO → Bet is emotional, SKIP IT

**Emotional Regulation Protocol:**  
- After any loss: 30-minute cooldown before next bet  
- After 2+ losses in day: Stop betting for the day  
- If feeling frustrated: Close sportsbook app, go for walk

**Remember:** Every bet you DON'T make is $0 saved. Not playing is sometimes the winning play.

## 🚪 EXIT CRITERIA

This Emergency Protocol remains ACTIVE until ALL of the following conditions are met:

### **Financial Criteria:**  
- ✅ Bankroll reaches $650+ (11.7% recovery from $582)  
- ✅ Sustained for 3+ days (no immediate drawdown)

### **Performance Criteria:**  
- ✅ 10-day positive streak OR 70%+ win rate over 30 bets (whichever comes first)  
- ✅ Zero protocol violations in last 7 days  
- ✅ Demonstrated discipline (no tilt bets, no emotional decisions)

### **Psychological Criteria:**  
- ✅ Clear attribution of what works (can explain WHY you're winning)  
- ✅ Confidence restored (betting feels systematic, not desperate)  
- ✅ No "revenge betting" thoughts

### **Deactivation Process:**  
1. Meet all criteria above  
2. Document lessons learned from Emergency Protocol period  
3. Write "Return to Normal Operations" protocol (what changes)  
4. Gradually reintroduce restricted bet types (NFL, parlays, etc.)  
5. Monitor closely for regression

**Do NOT rush deactivation.** Better to stay in Emergency Protocol 30 days and rebuild properly than exit early and re-trigger losses.

## 🔧 VIOLATION CONSEQUENCES

Violations compromise protocol integrity. Enforcement is mandatory.

| Violation | Penalty |
|-----------|---------|
| **NFL bet placed** | 48-hour full betting pause |
| **Parlay created** | 24-hour pause |
| **Exceeded $15 slate limit** | 24-hour pause |
| **Unverified player bet** | 48-hour pause + document the failure |
| **Tilt bet detected** | 24-hour pause + mandatory reflection |
| **2+ violations in 7 days** | Full protocol review, extend by 7 days |

**Why harsh penalties?** Emergency Protocol only works if followed. Violations = regression to patterns that caused bleeding.

**Self-enforcement:** You're the only referee. Honesty required.

---

## 💡 PROTOCOL PHILOSOPHY

### **Why This Works:**

**Simplicity:** 7 rules, not 70 pages. ADHD-compatible.

**Containment:** Removes biggest bleed (NFL), focuses on proven edge (NHL foundation).

**Risk Reduction:** Smaller units + straight bets + limited exposure = lower variance.

**Psychological Safety:** Clear boundaries = less decision fatigue. Permission to pause = prevents tilt.

**Measurable:** Bankroll up/down is binary. No ambiguity.

### **What This Is NOT:**

❌ Permanent system (this is temporary containment)  
❌ Optimal EV strategy (this is risk management, not edge maximization)  
❌ "Fun" betting (this is disciplined rehabilitation)  
❌ Long-term playbook (return to full system after recovery)

### **The Goal:**

Get back to $650, rebuild confidence, then **methodically reintroduce** advanced strategies with lessons learned.

**Slow is smooth. Smooth is fast. Fast is winning.**
