## 🎯 System Overview

### Purpose

The Emergency Protocol System exists to:

1. **Prevent Catastrophic Losses** - Stop bleeding before bankroll damage becomes severe
2. **Enforce Discipline** - Remove emotion from decision-making during crisis
3. **Systematic Recovery** - Provide structured path back to normal operations
4. **Protect Psychology** - Maintain confidence and prevent tilt

### Core Philosophy

**"The best time to prepare for a crisis is before it happens."**

Emergency protocols are pre-defined responses that activate automatically when trigger conditions are met. This removes emotion and ego from the equation during the most dangerous moments in sports betting.

## ⚠️ Trigger Conditions

### Automatic Activation Triggers

Emergency protocols **MUST** be activated when any of these conditions are met:

#### Trigger 1: Consecutive Losses
```
ACTIVATE IF: 3 or more consecutive losing bets

Severity Levels:
- 3 losses in a row → YELLOW ALERT (Mild intervention)
- 5 losses in a row → ORANGE ALERT (Moderate intervention)
- 7+ losses in a row → RED ALERT (Severe intervention)
```

#### Trigger 2: Bankroll Drawdown
```
ACTIVATE IF: Bankroll down 20% or more from peak

Severity Levels:
- 20-25% drawdown → YELLOW ALERT
- 25-35% drawdown → ORANGE ALERT
- 35%+ drawdown → RED ALERT (Full system pause)
```

#### Trigger 3: Emotional Compromise
```
ACTIVATE IF: Any of the following detected:
- Revenge betting urges (wanting to "get it back")
- Chasing losses with increased stakes
- Deviating from protocols without justification
- Feeling frustrated, angry, or desperate
- Skipping analysis to rush bets
```

#### Trigger 4: System Breakdown
```
ACTIVATE IF: Any of the following occurs:
- Multiple protocol violations in single session
- Betting without proper analysis
- Ignoring goalie confirmations or data verification
- Portfolio rules violated
- ADHD execution protocol abandoned
```

### Manual Activation

Emergency protocols can also be activated **voluntarily** if:
- You feel something is "off" even without meeting triggers
- Pattern of "close losses" suggesting analysis breakdown
- External life stress impacting betting focus
- Sensing early warning signs before triggers met

**It's better to activate early than wait for full crisis.**

## 🔄 Crisis Response Workflow

### Immediate Response (First 15 Minutes)

```
STEP 1: STOP ALL BETTING ACTIVITY
├─ Do not place any new bets
├─ Do not add to existing positions
├─ Close all sportsbook apps/tabs
└─ Take 15-minute break from screens

STEP 2: ACKNOWLEDGE THE TRIGGER
├─ Write down what triggered emergency protocol
├─ Document current emotional state
├─ Note specific trigger condition met
└─ Timestamp the activation

STEP 3: OPEN EMERGENCY PROTOCOL
├─ Navigate to emergency-protocols/stop-the-bleeding-protocol.md
├─ Read ENTIRE protocol (don't skip)
├─ Open protocols/emergency-playbook.md
└─ Have both open for reference

STEP 4: ASSESS SEVERITY
├─ Calculate exact bankroll drawdown %
├─ Count consecutive losses
├─ Rate emotional state (1-10 scale)
└─ Determine alert level (YELLOW/ORANGE/RED)
```

### Analysis Phase (Next 30 Minutes)

```
STEP 5: REVIEW RECENT ACTIVITY
├─ Open tracking/bet-log.md
├─ Review last 10-20 bets
├─ Identify losing pattern (if exists)
└─ Note: Type of bets, situations, protocols used

STEP 6: CONSULT INSTITUTIONAL KNOWLEDGE
├─ Open tracking/COMPLETE-LESSONS-LEARNED.md
├─ Search for similar past situations
├─ Review "Mistakes to Avoid" section
└─ Check if current situation is documented

STEP 7: PROTOCOL COMPLIANCE CHECK
├─ Did you follow protocols on losing bets?
├─ Were shortcuts taken?
├─ Were warning signs ignored?
└─ Document any protocol violations

STEP 8: ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFICATION
Determine which category applies:
├─ VARIANCE (bad luck, correct process)
├─ ANALYSIS ERROR (wrong reads, bad process)
├─ PROTOCOL VIOLATION (didn't follow system)
└─ EMOTIONAL DECISION (tilt, revenge, rushing)
```

### Recovery Planning (Next 15 Minutes)

```
STEP 9: DEFINE RECOVERY STRATEGY
Based on root cause:

IF VARIANCE:
├─ No system changes needed
├─ Reduce stakes by 25% temporarily
├─ Continue normal protocols
└─ Trust the process

IF ANALYSIS ERROR:
├─ Identify what was missed
├─ Add to COMPLETE-LESSONS-LEARNED.md
├─ Reduce stakes by 50% temporarily
├─ Double-check analyses going forward
└─ Consider skipping next slate (reset)

IF PROTOCOL VIOLATION:
├─ Recommit to protocols
├─ Reduce stakes by 50%
├─ Add mandatory checklist verification
├─ No betting until protocols re-reviewed
└─ Consider 24-48 hour pause

IF EMOTIONAL DECISION:
├─ MANDATORY 48+ hour pause
├─ No betting until emotional equilibrium restored
├─ Reduce stakes by 75% upon return
├─ Consider professional support if recurring
└─ Implement additional emotional safeguards

STEP 10: DOCUMENT RECOVERY PLAN
├─ Write specific recovery steps
├─ Set timeline for return to normal
├─ Define success metrics
└─ Share plan in daily-logs/
```

## 🛑 Stop the Bleeding Protocol

### stop-the-bleeding-protocol.md Overview

**File:** `emergency-protocols/stop-the-bleeding-protocol.md`  
**Size:** 13,400 bytes  
**Purpose:** Comprehensive losing streak management

**Key Sections:**

1. **Immediate Actions** - First steps when triggered
2. **Loss Analysis Framework** - Systematic review of what went wrong
3. **Psychological Reset** - Mental and emotional recovery
4. **Stake Reduction Guidelines** - How much to reduce unit sizes
5. **Return to Play Criteria** - When it's safe to resume normal operations
6. **Prevention Strategies** - How to avoid future triggers

### Core Principles from Protocol

**Principle 1: Pause is Power**
- Immediate pause is non-negotiable
- 24-48 hours minimum for emotional triggers
- No "light betting" or "testing the waters"

**Principle 2: Ego is the Enemy**
- Accept that something is wrong
- No rationalizing or making excuses
- Humble assessment required

**Principle 3: Protect the Bankroll**
- Bankroll preservation > ego preservation
- Better to pause too long than resume too soon
- Can't bet if bankroll is gone

**Principle 4: Process Over Results**
- Focus on decision quality, not outcomes
- If process was sound, variance is acceptable
- If process was flawed, results don't matter

**Principle 5: Systematic Recovery Only**
- No "hero bets" to recover losses
- Gradual stake increases only
- Must earn way back to full stakes

### Stake Reduction Table

From stop-the-bleeding-protocol.md:

| Alert Level | Drawdown/Losses | Base Unit Reduction | Return Criteria |
|-------------|----------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| **YELLOW** | 3 losses / 20% down | -25% stakes | 3 wins in next 5 bets |
| **ORANGE** | 5 losses / 25% down | -50% stakes | 5 wins in next 8 bets |
| **RED** | 7+ losses / 35% down | -75% stakes | 48hr pause + review |

### Return to Play Checklist

From stop-the-bleeding-protocol.md:

**Before Resuming Normal Operations:**

- [ ] Root cause identified and addressed
- [ ] Minimum pause period completed (based on alert level)
- [ ] Emotional state: calm, confident, patient (not desperate)
- [ ] Return criteria met (win rate targets)

## 🔗 Integration with Core Systems

### Integration with Bankroll Management

**APEXVIPER_BANKROLL_MANAGEMENT.md**

Emergency protocols automatically adjust:
```
Normal Operations:
- Base unit = 2% of bankroll
- Tier A = $2.50
- Tier B = $2.00

YELLOW ALERT:
- Base unit = 1.5% of bankroll
- Tier A = $1.90
- Tier B = $1.50

ORANGE ALERT:
- Base unit = 1% of bankroll
- Tier A = $1.25
- Tier B = $1.00

RED ALERT:
- PAUSE ALL BETTING
- No stakes until cleared
```

### Integration with Tracking

**tracking/bet-log.md**
```
Emergency protocol activations logged as:

### EMERGENCY PROTOCOL ACTIVATED - [Date]

**Trigger:** [What caused activation]
**Alert Level:** [YELLOW/ORANGE/RED]
**Action Taken:** [Immediate response]
**Status:** [Active/Resolved]
**Resolution Date:** [When normal ops resumed]
```

**tracking/lessons-learned.md**
```
Every emergency activation requires lesson entry:

## [Date] - Emergency Protocol Activation

**Situation:** [What led to trigger]
**Root Cause:** [Variance/Analysis/Protocol/Emotional]
**Lesson:** [What was learned]
**Prevention:** [How to avoid in future]
```

### Integration with Daily Logs

**daily-logs/**
```
Emergency activation noted in daily log:

## 🚨 EMERGENCY PROTOCOL ACTIVATED

**Time:** [HH:MM]
**Trigger:** [Specific condition]
**Level:** [YELLOW/ORANGE/RED]
**Immediate Action:** [What was done]
**See:** emergency-protocols/stop-the-bleeding-protocol.md
**Status:** BETTING PAUSED until [criteria met]
```

### Integration with Execution Protocol

**APEXVIPER_ADHD_EXECUTION_PROTOCOL_v3.2.0.md**

Emergency check added to pre-execution:
```
STEP 0: EMERGENCY PROTOCOL CHECK (NEW)

Before ANY bet execution:
1. Check tracking/bankroll.md for current drawdown
2. Count consecutive losses in bet-log.md
3. Self-assess emotional state (1-10)
4. IF any trigger condition met → STOP
5. IF clear → Proceed to normal execution

This check takes 30 seconds and can save your bankroll.
```
