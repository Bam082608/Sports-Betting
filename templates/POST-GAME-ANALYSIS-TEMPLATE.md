- Ticket type breakdown (performance by type)
- Lessons learned (actionable takeaways)
- Protocol adherence (did you follow process?)

**Optional (if time limited):**
- Detailed game-by-game review (can abbreviate)
- Player performance notes (capture highlights only)

### Integration with Other Systems

**Update These After Analysis:**
- `/tracking/bet-log.md` - Add today's bets
- `/tracking/lessons-learned.md` - Add key lessons
- `/tracking/pattern-log.md` - Add any patterns identified
- `/playbook/README.md` - Update ticket type performance table
