## 🚨 EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS

**If Time-Constrained (Rush Hour):**

- Skip God Mode entirely
- Use Enhanced Fat Finger Protocol

**If Bankroll Concerns:**
- Skip games with conviction <7/10
- Reduce all allocations by 25-50%
- Skip God Mode
- Focus on Tickets 1-2 only (foundation)

**If Analysis Paralysis:**
- Use DEPLOYMENT-DECISION-TREE.md
- Set 8-minute timer per game
- If timer expires, skip game
- Quality over quantity

## 📝 POST-SLATE REVIEW

**After All Games Complete:**
- [ ] Update bet tracker with results
- [ ] Calculate per-game P/L
- [ ] Calculate per-ticket-type win rates
