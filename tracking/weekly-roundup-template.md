## 1. HOT STREAK ALERTS 🔥

### Players Trending UP (Target for Bets)

| Player | Team | Position | L5 SOG/GP | L10 SOG/GP | Delta | L5 Hit Rate (2+) | Action |
|--------|------|----------|-----------|------------|-------|------------------|--------|
|        |      |          |           |            |       |                  | BET HEAVY |
|        |      |          |           |            |       |                  | VALUE PLAY |
|        |      |          |           |            |       |                  | MONITOR |
|        |      |          |           |            |       |                  |        |
|        |      |          |           |            |       |                  |        |

### Hot Streak Calculation Formula
```
Delta = L5 Average - L10 Average
If Delta > +0.5 → Trending hot, consider targeting
If Delta > +1.0 → On fire, BET HEAVY designation

L5 Hit Rate = (Games with 2+ SOG in L5) / 5 × 100%
If L5 Hit Rate > 80% → Strong candidate for overs
```

### Hot Streak Notes

## 2. COLD STREAK ALERTS ❄️

### Players Trending DOWN (Avoid or Fade)

| Player | Team | Position | L5 SOG/GP | L10 SOG/GP | Delta | L5 Hit Rate (2+) | Action |
|--------|------|----------|-----------|------------|-------|------------------|--------|
|        |      |          |           |            |       |                  | FADE |
|        |      |          |           |            |       |                  | AVOID |
|        |      |          |           |            |       |                  | MONITOR |
|        |      |          |           |            |       |                  |        |
|        |      |          |           |            |       |                  |        |

### Cold Streak Calculation Formula
```
Delta = L5 Average - L10 Average
If Delta < -0.5 → Trending cold, proceed with caution
If Delta < -1.0 → In a slump, FADE or AVOID

L5 Hit Rate = (Games with 2+ SOG in L5) / 5 × 100%
If L5 Hit Rate < 40% → Strong fade candidate
```

## TREND FORMULAS QUICK REFERENCE

### Average SOG Calculation
```
L5 SOG/GP = Total SOG in Last 5 Games / 5
L10 SOG/GP = Total SOG in Last 10 Games / 10
```

### Delta Calculation
```
Delta = L5 Average - L10 Average

Interpretation:
- Delta > +1.0 = On Fire 🔥
- Delta > +0.5 = Trending Up
- Delta between -0.5 and +0.5 = Stable
- Delta < -0.5 = Trending Down
- Delta < -1.0 = Cold Streak ❄️
```

### Hit Rate Calculation
```
Hit Rate (2+ SOG) = Games with 2+ SOG / Total Games × 100%

Example: Player had 2+ SOG in 4 of last 5 games
Hit Rate = 4/5 × 100% = 80%
```

### Win Rate Calculation
```
Win Rate = Bets Won / Total Bets × 100%
```

### ROI Calculation
```
ROI = Net Profit / Total Wagered × 100%
```
