## 🎯 ACTIVE STRATEGY RULES

### ✅ DO MORE (Proven Winners)
| Strategy | Win Rate | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| Cold Weather TE Stacking | HIGH | TEs become safety valves in 25-35°F games |
| Foundation Shot Props (2+ SOG) | HIGH | Elite shooters hit regardless of game flow |
| Backup Goalie Fades | HIGH | Elite goalie OUT = automatic fade opportunity |
| Verified Tier 1 Stars | HIGH | Robertson/Hintz/proven volume producers |

### ❌ STOP/REDUCE (Proven Losers)
| Strategy | Issue | Action |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Period-Specific Props (2P/3P SOG) | Too granular, wrong timing | **STOP** |
| Middles on 50/50 Games | Only works with RIGHT team | **STOP** unless confident |
| Lottery Tickets < $1 | Losses add up, wins don't move needle | **MINIMUM $1** |
| Game Totals (Over/Under) | Coin flip even with good reasoning | **REDUCE** |

## 📈 PATTERN INTELLIGENCE LOG

### Confirmed Edges (High Confidence)
1. **Backup Goalie Fade** - When elite goalie OUT, fade that team aggressively
2. **Cold Weather TEs** - 25-35°F games = TE safety valve routes
3. **Foundation Shooters** - Elite SOG producers hit regardless of score/situation
4. **Verified Tier 1 Stars** - Proven volume players deserve bigger stakes

### Retired Strategies (Stop Betting)
1. **Period-Specific SOG** - Too timing-dependent, use full game
2. **Middles Without Confidence** - Only middle when winner is clear
3. **Sub-$1 Lottery** - Either $1+ or skip entirely

### Under Observation (Need More Data)
1. Game totals with backup goalies
2. Travel/fatigue angles
3. Division rivalry unders
