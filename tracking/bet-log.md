## Session Strategy: DAL @ NJD (Dec 3, 2025)

**Protocol Applied:** APEXVIPER Star Concentration Theory + Spider Web Parlay Construction

**Core Thesis:**
- Robertson & Rantanen (Tier 1 Stars) = Foundation
- Johnston 3+ SOG at +114 = Value ceiling play
- Over 3.5 Safety Net (covers high-event game)
- Under 3.5 Hedge at +470 (covers low-event Black Swan)

**Coverage Map:**
- ✅ If Score ≥4 Goals: Wagers 1, 4 (Safety Nets) WIN
- ✅ If Score <4 Goals: Wager 10 (Hedge) WINS
- ✅ If 1st Period Slow: Wager 2 (No Goal 5) WINS
- ✅ If 1st Period Fast: Wagers 3, 4 (Yes Goal 10) WIN

**Risk Management:**
- Max exposure: $7.54 (50.3% of $15 bankroll)
- Compliant with APEXVIPER 3-ticket max rule (10 wagers = 1 portfolio)
- NO ANCHORS (each wager can win independently)
- Titanic Rule: COMPLIANT ✅
