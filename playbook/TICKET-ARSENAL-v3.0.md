# 🎰 APEXVIPER TICKET ARSENAL v3.0

**Last Updated:** December 4, 2025 05:55 AM  
**Purpose:** Standardized betting structures for systematic deployment  
**Status:** RESEARCH PHASE (Testing combinations 1/25 games)  
**Philosophy:** Living, evolving system - guidelines, not laws

---

## 📋 SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE: THE LADDER

### **Core Concept:**

Build from foundation up, not scatter random bets. Create multiple profit paths with insurance built-in.

```markdown
TIER 1: FOUNDATION (Singles)
├─ Purpose: Establish floor, recover base risk
├─ Cost: $2.50-3.00
└─ If only 1 prop hits: Recover 60-80% of total risk

TIER 2: COMBINATIONS (2-3 legs)
├─ Purpose: Build profit on singles that hit
├─ Cost: $2.00-2.50
└─ If 2+ props hit: Profit on both singles AND combos

TIER 3: GOD MODE (Everything combined)
├─ Purpose: Lottery jackpot if everything hits
├─ Cost: $0.25
└─ If all hit: Massive multiplier bonus

TOTAL PER GAME: $5.00-6.00 across 5-7 tickets
```

---

## 🎯 STANDARD GAME DEPLOYMENT

### **Template Structure (Per Game):**

```markdown
TICKET 1: BEST SINGLE PROP ($1.50)
├─ Highest confidence player
├─ Example: Gauthier 3+ SOG, Ovechkin 2+ SOG
└─ Target odds: -150 to +120

TICKET 2: SECOND SINGLE PROP ($1.00)
├─ Backup high-confidence player
├─ Example: Terry 2+ SOG, Bedard 2+ SOG
└─ Target odds: -120 to +150

TICKET 3: TOTAL (IF CLEAR NARRATIVE) ($1.00)
├─ Over 5.5 (offensive narrative)
├─ Under 6.5 (defensive narrative)
└─ Skip if narrative unclear

TICKET 4: BEST 2-LEG COMBO ($1.00-1.25)
├─ Player A + Player B (if both solid)
├─ Player A + Total (if narrative clear)
├─ Player A + Spread (safety net)
└─ Target odds: +150 to +250

TICKET 5: ALTERNATE 2-LEG ($0.75-1.00)
├─ Different combo than Ticket 4
├─ Example: If Ticket 4 = A+B, Ticket 5 = A+Over
└─ Diversifies correlation risk

TICKET 6: 3-LEG SAFETY (Optional, $0.50-0.75)
├─ Spread + Player + Total
├─ More conservative odds
└─ Adds stability if singles weak

TICKET 7: GOD MODE ($0.25)
├─ All best legs combined: 4-6 total
├─ Target odds: +2000 minimum
└─ Pure lottery, entertainment value

TOTAL: $5.00-6.00
TIME TO PLACE: 5-10 minutes with Fat Finger Protocol
```

## 🛡️ TYPE 1: THE ANCHOR (3 VARIANTS)

**Status:** Updated to v2.1 on 12/3/25  
**Change:** Split into 3 variants based on game narrative  
**Reason:** Discovered we were betting opposites (Over+Under) on same ticket

### **VARIANT A: DEFENSIVE ANCHOR**

**Use When:**
```markdown
INDICATORS:
├─ Elite goalie matchup (both >.915 SV%)
├─ B2B fatigue (expected low energy)
├─ Strong defensive teams
├─ Low total line (Under 5.5)
├─ You're betting Under insurance separately
└─ Narrative: "This will be a grind"

GAME SCRIPT EXPECTED: 2-1, 3-1, 2-0 type games
```

**Structure:**
```markdown
3 LEGS:
├─ Team Spread (+2.5 or +3.5)
├─ Star Player 2+ SOG
└─ Under 6.5 or Under 7.5 (NO OVER)

COST: $1.25-1.50
TARGET ODDS: +120 to +180

EXAMPLE (Dallas 12/3/25 - SHOULD HAVE USED):
├─ DAL +2.5 ✅
├─ Robertson 2+ SOG ✅
└─ Under 6.5 ✅
WOULD HAVE WON: 3/3 legs
```

**Critical Rule:**
> "If betting Under insurance separately, use Defensive Anchor. Don't bet Over in Anchor if you're betting Under as hedge."

---

### **VARIANT B: OFFENSIVE ANCHOR**

**Use When:**
```markdown
INDICATORS:
├─ Backup goalie(s) <.900 SV%
├─ Missing defensive stars
├─ High total line (Over 6.5)
├─ Both teams score a lot historically
├─ You're NOT betting Under insurance
└─ Narrative: "This will be a shootout"

GAME SCRIPT EXPECTED: 5-4, 6-3, 7-5 type games
```

**Structure:**
```markdown
3 LEGS:
├─ Team Spread (+2.5 or +3.5)
├─ Star Player 2+ SOG
└─ Over 5.5 or Over 6.5 (NO UNDER)

COST: $1.25-1.50
TARGET ODDS: +120 to +180

EXAMPLE (Anaheim 12/3/25 - WHAT WE SHOULD HAVE USED):
├─ ANA +2.5 [game went 0-7, so this failed]
├─ Gauthier 2+ SOG [team floor killed it]
└─ Over 6.5 ✅ (game had 7 goals)
LESSON: Even correct structure can't beat black swan events
```

**Critical Rule:**
> "If expecting offense, use Offensive Anchor. Don't bet Under if narrative is shootout."

---

### **VARIANT C: MIDDLE ANCHOR (RARE)**

**Use When:**
```markdown
INDICATORS:
├─ No clear narrative (balanced matchup)
├─ Standard starters (no backup chaos)
├─ Medium total line (5.5-6.5)
├─ Evenly matched offenses
├─ You genuinely think 4-6 goal game
└─ Narrative: "This could go either way"

GAME SCRIPT EXPECTED: 4-3, 3-2, 4-2 type games
THIS IS RARE: Most games have clear narrative
```

**Structure:**
```markdown
4 LEGS:
├─ Team Spread (+2.5 or +3.5)
├─ Star Player 2+ SOG
├─ Over 4.5 (floor protection)
└─ Under 7.5 (ceiling protection)

COST: $1.25-1.50
TARGET ODDS: Even to +150

WIN RANGE: 5-7 total goals
SWEET SPOT: 5-3, 4-3, 4-4 games
```

**Critical Rule:**
> "Only use Middle Anchor when you CAN'T decide narrative. If narrative is clear, use Defensive or Offensive."

---

### **ANCHOR DECISION MATRIX:**

```markdown
STEP 1: Identify Game Narrative

DEFENSIVE INDICATORS (3+ = Use Defensive Anchor):
├─ Elite goalie SV% >.915
├─ B2B fatigue
├─ Strong team defense (allow <2.5 GPG)
├─ Low total line <5.5
├─ Betting Under insurance
├─ Recent low-scoring games
└─ Playoff-style intensity expected

OFFENSIVE INDICATORS (3+ = Use Offensive Anchor):
├─ Backup goalie <.900 SV%
├─ Missing defensive stars
├─ Weak team defense (allow >3.5 GPG)
├─ High total line >6.5
├─ Both teams hot offensively
├─ Recent high-scoring games
└─ Wide-open style matchup

BALANCED INDICATORS (Default to skip or use Middle):
├─ Standard starters
├─ Medium total line 5.5-6.5
├─ No clear edge
├─ Can't articulate narrative
└─ Uncertainty

STEP 2: Match Structure to Narrative

IF DEFENSIVE → Defensive Anchor (Under only)
IF OFFENSIVE → Offensive Anchor (Over only)
IF BALANCED → Middle Anchor (both) OR skip Anchor entirely

CRITICAL: If betting insurance, match Anchor to insurance
Example: Betting Under 3.5 insurance? Use Defensive Anchor (don't bet Over 3.5 too)
```

---

## 🎯 TYPE 2: VOLUME STACK

**Purpose:** Capture offensive explosion from one team  
**Test Status:** Ongoing (need more data)

**Structure:**
```markdown
2-3 LEGS:
├─ Shooter A: 2+ SOG (primary volume driver)
├─ Shooter B: 2+ SOG (line mate or PP partner)
└─ Team Spread +2.5 (optional safety)

COST: $1.00-1.25
TARGET ODDS: +100 to +200
FREQUENCY: 1-2 per game (when clear opportunity)
```

**When to Use:**
```markdown
TRIGGER CONDITIONS:
├─ Team missing stars ("Next Man Up" volume)
├─ Facing weak goalie (<.900 SV%)
├─ Desperate situation (must-win game)
├─ Volume shooters confirmed in top-6 lines
└─ PP1 both on same unit

AVOID:
├─ Elite opposing goalie (>.920 SV%)
├─ Shooters on different lines (no synergy)
├─ Heavy defensive matchup expected
└─ Team in offensive slump
```

**Example (Conceptual):**
```markdown
DAL @ NJD (12/3/25):
├─ Hintz 2+ SOG (injured, but if healthy)
├─ Robertson 2+ SOG (PP1, top line)
└─ DAL +2.5 (safety spread)

Cost: $1.25 | Target odds: +180-220
Logic: Both on PP1, both shoot volume, spread protects downside
```

**Performance Data:** TBD (need 10 games)

---

## 🪞 TYPE 3: THE MIRROR

**Purpose:** Profit regardless of winner (competitive games)  
**Test Status:** Limited data, needs more testing

**Structure:**
```markdown
TWO SEPARATE TICKETS:

TICKET A (Team A):
├─ Team A Spread +2.5
├─ Team A Shooter 2+ SOG
└─ Cost: $1.00-1.25

TICKET B (Team B):
├─ Team B Spread +2.5  
├─ Team B Shooter 2+ SOG
└─ Cost: $1.00-1.25

TOTAL COST: $2.00-2.50
WIN CONDITIONS:
├─ Game within 1-2 goals: Both tickets can cash ("middle")
├─ One team wins by 3+: One ticket cashes
└─ Rare scenario: Both lose (blowout >3 goals)
```

**When to Use:**
```markdown
IDEAL CONDITIONS:
├─ Competitive matchup (both teams strong)
├─ Close odds (neither heavy favorite)
├─ "Grind" game narrative expected
├─ Both offenses capable
└─ Uncertainty about winner

AVOID:
├─ Heavy favorite matchups (-250+)
├─ Clear mismatch
├─ One team on B2B (fatigue advantage)
└─ Blowout expected
```

**Performance Data:** TBD (need 10 games)

---

## 🦢 TYPE 4: BLACK SWAN INSURANCE

**Purpose:** Insurance against defensive grind killing offensive bets  
**Test Status:** ✅ VALIDATED (Dallas 12/3/25)

**Structure:**
```markdown
1 LEG:
└─ Alternate Total UNDER 3.5 (or Under 2.5)

COST: $0.50-0.75
TARGET ODDS: +300 to +500
FREQUENCY: When heavy on overs/volume props
```

**The Logic:**
```markdown
SCENARIO A: Offense explodes (expected)
├─ Your volume bets win
├─ Black Swan loses $0.75
└─ Net: Big profit minus small insurance cost

SCENARIO B: Defense dominates (unexpected)
├─ Your volume bets lose
├─ Black Swan wins $2-4 (at +300-500 odds)
└─ Net: Losses covered, break-even or small profit

INSURANCE MATH:
Cost: $0.75
Coverage: Pays $2.50-3.75 (if +300-500)
Protects: $3-6 in offensive tickets
ROI: If hits 1 in 5 times, profitable as insurance
```

**When to Use:**
```markdown
TRIGGER CONDITIONS:
├─ 3+ tickets with Over props
├─ 3+ tickets with volume player props
├─ Heavy offensive deployment
├─ Backup goalie chaos expected
└─ "What if this is a 1-0 game?" thought occurs

SIZING:
├─ 10-15% of game portfolio
├─ Target +300 odds minimum
└─ Think of it as portfolio insurance premium
```

**Validation Example (Dallas 12/3/25):**
```markdown
DEPLOYED:
├─ 8 tickets with offensive props/overs: $7.74
├─ Black Swan Under 3.5: $0.55 at +470
└─ Total: $8.29

RESULT:
├─ Game went 3-0 (defensive)
├─ Most offensive tickets lost
├─ Black Swan won: $0.55 → $3.14 (+$2.59)
└─ Saved entire portfolio from catastrophic loss

LESSON: Insurance works exactly as designed
```

**Status:** ✅ KEEP AS MANDATORY when over-exposed to offense

---

## 🎲 TYPE 5: GOD MODE

**Purpose:** Lottery entertainment + black swan blowout coverage  
**Test Status:** Ongoing (0 hits yet, small sample)

**Structure:**
```markdown
6-9 LEGS:
├─ Mix of 2+ and 3+ SOG props
├─ Aggressive totals (Over 6.5)
├─ D-man shots (if available)
├─ Team spreads
└─ "Everything goes right" scenario

COST: $0.15-0.25 MAXIMUM
TARGET ODDS: +2000 to +10000
FREQUENCY: Once per game MAXIMUM
```

**Construction Guidelines:**
```markdown
BUILDING GOD MODE:
1. Take all singles that hit in Tier 1
2. Take best combo from Tier 2
3. Add total if clear narrative
4. Add spread for safety
5. Maybe add bonus prop (D-man, 3+, etc.)
6. Target: 6-8 total legs

EXAMPLE STRUCTURE:
├─ Player A 2+ SOG (from Ticket 1)
├─ Player B 2+ SOG (from Ticket 2)
├─ Player C 2+ SOG (bonus)
├─ Over 6.5 (if offensive game)
├─ Team A +2.5 (safety spread)
└─ Player A 3+ SOG (aggressive bonus)

TARGET ODDS: +3000-8000
PAYOUT: $0.25 → $7.50-20.00
```

**When It Hits:**
```markdown
WIN SCENARIO: Everything goes right
├─ All shooters get volume
├─ Game goes over
├─ Team covers spread
└─ Bonus props hit

FREQUENCY: 1 in 20-40 games (2-5% hit rate)
REQUIRED ODDS: Must be +2000+ to justify
ENTERTAINMENT VALUE: Watching score updates for jackpot
```

**Rules:**
```markdown
NEVER:
├─ Bet more than $0.25
├─ Chase God Mode losses
├─ Let it ride if cashing early possible
├─ Expect it to hit (it's a bonus)
└─ Build portfolio around God Mode

ALWAYS:
├─ Think of it as entertainment fee
├─ If it hits: Celebrate, don't increase size
├─ Track: Does it hit often enough?
└─ After 25 games: Review if worth continuing
```

**Performance Data:** TBD (need 25 games to assess value)

---

## ⭐ TYPE 6: SUPERSTAR LADDER

**Purpose:** Target elite shooters vs weak matchups  
**Test Status:** Limited data (need Tier 1 star validation)

**Structure:**
```markdown
2-3 LEGS:
├─ Elite Star: 3+ SOG (HIGH bar, aggressive)
├─ Secondary: 2+ SOG (line mate or PP partner)
└─ Team Spread (+2.5) (optional safety)

COST: $0.50-0.75
TARGET ODDS: +150 to +250
FREQUENCY: 2-3 times per week (selective, not every game)
```

**When to Use:**
```markdown
IDEAL CONDITIONS:
├─ Star Concentration >25% (Tier 1 star)
├─ Weak opposing goalie (<.900 SV%)
├─ Star confirmed healthy and hot
├─ Not on cold streak (3+ games without point)
└─ Favorable matchup (not elite defensive line)

TIER 1 STARS CONFIRMED:
├─ Cutter Gauthier (ANA): 31% concentration, 8 SOG avg
├─ Alex Ovechkin (WSH): Elite volume, Free Will Theory
└─ [Others to be validated through testing]

TIER 1 CANDIDATES (Need testing):
├─ Connor Bedard (CHI): High usage, shoot-first
├─ Auston Matthews (TOR): Elite shooter when healthy
├─ Nathan MacKinnon (COL): Volume machine
└─ [Track over next 10 games]
```

**Avoid:**
```markdown
DON'T USE:
├─ Star on cold streak
├─ Elite goalie opposing (>.920 SV%)
├─ Heavy defensive matchup
├─ Every game (dilutes value)
└─ If star questionable (injury concern)
```

**Performance Data:** TBD (need 10 games on Tier 1 stars)

---

## 🎯 TYPE 7: THE SPECIALIST

**Purpose:** Capture PP2 or depth line value  
**Test Status:** Very limited data

**Structure:**
```markdown
3-4 LEGS:
├─ Non-star shooter A: 2+ SOG
├─ Non-star shooter B: 2+ SOG
├─ D-man or depth forward: 2+ SOG
└─ Team spreads for safety (both teams)

COST: $0.50-0.75
TARGET ODDS: +250 to +400
FREQUENCY: Deep/balanced lineups only
```

**When to Use:**
```markdown
IDEAL CONDITIONS:
├─ Team has balanced scoring (not star-dependent)
├─ PP2 gets significant ice time
├─ Depth players in good matchups
├─ Value odds available
└─ Stars are injured (volume shifts down)

AVOID:
├─ Star-dependent teams (top line gets all shots)
├─ PP2 rarely deployed
├─ Depth players in defensive roles
└─ Can't identify value
```

**Logic:**
```markdown
WHY IT WORKS (In Theory):
- Higher odds than star props (market undervalues)
- Still volume-based (not luck)
- Covers "balanced attack" games
- When stars don't dominate, depth delivers

RISK:
- Lower hit rate than stars
- Need multiple legs to get decent odds
- One weak link kills ticket
```

**Performance Data:** TBD (not enough tests)

---

## 🧪 TYPE 8: TIME-HEDGED ANCHOR (EXPERIMENTAL)

**Purpose:** Capture time volatility while maintaining safety  
**Test Status:** 🧪 1/5 GAMES COMPLETE (Dallas 12/3/25: ✅ WIN)

**Structure:**
```markdown

TICKET B:
├─ Same anchor legs
└─ NO Goal First 10 Minutes

OPTIONAL TICKET C:
├─ Same anchor legs
└─ NO Goal First 5 Minutes

TOTAL COST: $1.50-2.00 across 2-3 tickets

├─ Ticket B (NO 10min): ✅ WINS
└─ Ticket C (NO 5min): ✅ WINS
RESULT: TWO tickets cash

SCENARIO D: Late goal (10+ minutes)
├─ Ticket A (YES 10min): ✅ Loses
├─ Ticket B (NO 10min): ✅ WINS
└─ Ticket C (NO 5min): ✅ WINS
RESULT: TWO tickets cash
```

**Test Results So Far:**
```markdown
GAME 1 (Dallas 12/3/25):
Ticket: DAL +2.5 + Under 6.5 + NO Goal First 5 Min
Cost: $0.75 | Odds: +441
Result: ✅ ALL THREE LEGS HIT
Profit: +$0.76
Status: 1/5 validation complete

WIN RATE: 100% (1/1)
SAMPLE SIZE: Too small to conclude
DECISION PENDING: Need 4 more tests
```

**Testing Protocol:**
```markdown
NEXT 4 GAMES:
├─ Deploy on Tier 1 or Tier 2 games only
├─ Track: Which time window hits most often
├─ Cost: $0.75-1.00 per test
└─ Total commitment: $3-4 more

PASS THRESHOLD (After 5 games):
└─ 3/5 games profitable (60% win rate)

FAIL THRESHOLD:
└─ 0-1/5 games profitable (<30% win rate)

IF PASS:
└─ Promote to standard arsenal (Type 8)

IF FAIL:
└─ Archive as "interesting but unprofitable"

IF INCONCLUSIVE (2/5):
└─ Extend test to 10 games, then decide
```

**Current Assessment:** Promising (1/1) but need more data

## 🎯 DEPLOYMENT DECISION TREE

### **Pre-Game Workflow:**

```markdown
STEP 1: TIER CLASSIFICATION (5 min)
[ ] Check starting goalies (DailyFaceoff.com)
[ ] Verify injuries (NHL.com, beat reporters)
[ ] Review B2B status
[ ] Classify: Tier 1 / Tier 2 / Tier 3 (or skip)

STEP 2: NARRATIVE IDENTIFICATION (3 min)
[ ] Defensive game? (elite goalies, B2B, low total)
[ ] Offensive game? (backup goalies, high total, weak defense)
[ ] Balanced? (standard matchup, medium total)
[ ] Decide: Which Anchor variant to use (if any)

STEP 3: LADDER CONSTRUCTION (10 min)
[ ] Tier 1: Identify 2 best single props ($2.50-3.00)
[ ] Tier 2: Build 2 best combos ($2.00-2.50)
[ ] Tier 3: Construct God Mode with all legs ($0.25)
[ ] Total check: $5.00-6.00 ✅

STEP 4: CORRELATION CHECK (2 min)
[ ] Same player in 3+ tickets? (over-concentration)
[ ] Betting Over AND Under separately? (good)
[ ] Betting Over AND Under on same ticket? (bad unless Middle)
[ ] All tickets need same outcome? (Florida Massacre risk)

STEP 5: EXECUTION (5-10 min)
[ ] Build each ticket
[ ] FAT FINGER PROTOCOL every bet
│   ├─ Say amount out loud
│   ├─ 2-second pause
│   ├─ Screenshot
│   └─ Submit
[ ] Verify in "My Bets"
[ ] Document in bet-log

TOTAL TIME: ~25-30 minutes per game
```

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL RULES

### **Never:**
```markdown
❌ Combine Over + Under on same ticket (unless Middle Anchor)
❌ Bet more than $6 per game without bankroll growth
❌ Put same player in 4+ tickets (concentration risk)
❌ Skip Fat Finger Protocol (even for small bets)
❌ Bet during games (no live betting)
❌ Rush bets when driving/working (use Rush Hour Protocol)
❌ Chase God Mode losses
❌ Deviate from tested structures without reason
```

### **Always:**
```markdown
✅ Match Anchor variant to game narrative
✅ Use Black Swan insurance when over-exposed
✅ Verify goalies/injuries <90 min before game
✅ Screenshot every bet before submit
✅ Track performance by ticket type
✅ Diversify across multiple tickets
✅ Have clear justification for every bet
✅ Document learnings after each session
```

## 🐍 SYSTEM PHILOSOPHY REMINDER

**This Arsenal is a LIVING DOCUMENT**

```markdown
CURRENT STATUS: RESEARCH PHASE
├─ Testing different combinations
├─ Collecting win rate data
├─ Finding optimal structures
└─ NOT final protocol yet

AFTER 10-25 GAMES:
├─ Lock in 4-6 best performers
├─ Drop underperformers
├─ Shift to EXECUTION phase
└─ Consistent deployment of proven structures

THE GOAL:
Not to follow rigid rules, but to:
├─ Engineer solutions through testing
├─ Iterate based on results
├─ Build the most lethal system
└─ $40 → $569 → $1000+ through systematic improvement
