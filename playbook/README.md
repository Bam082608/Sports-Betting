# 🎰 APEXVIPER PLAYBOOK

**Purpose:** Standardized betting structures and strategies

## Contents

### Ticket Arsenal
- **[TICKET-ARSENAL-v2.md](TICKET-ARSENAL-v2.md)** - 8 standardized ticket types with deployment models

## Usage

The playbook contains named, repeatable betting structures that have been tested and validated. Each ticket type has:
- Specific structure (legs, sizing)
- Use cases (when to deploy)
- Historical performance data
- Iteration history

## Playbook Philosophy

**Before Playbook:**
- Guessing bet structures
- Inconsistent sizing
- No performance tracking by type

**After Playbook:**
- Named ticket types
- Standard deployment models
- Track win rates by type
- Data-driven iteration
