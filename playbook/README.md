# 🎰 APEXVIPER PLAYBOOK

**Purpose:** Standardized betting structures and strategies

## Contents

### Ticket Arsenal
- **[TICKET-ARSENAL-v3.md](TICKET-ARSENAL-v3.md)** - Arsenal v3.0: Split Over/Under system, 6-ticket deployment model (CURRENT)
- **[TICKET-ARSENAL-v2.md](TICKET-ARSENAL-v2.md)** - Arsenal v2.1: 8 standardized ticket types (DEPRECATED)

## Usage

The playbook contains named, repeatable betting structures that have been tested and validated. Each ticket type has:
- Specific structure (legs, sizing)
- Use cases (when to deploy)
- Historical performance data
- Iteration history

## Playbook Philosophy

**Before Playbook:**
- Guessing bet structures
- Inconsistent sizing
- No performance tracking by type
- Combining conflicting props (Over + Under on same ticket)

**After Playbook (v3.0):**
- Named ticket types with clear structures
- Standard deployment models (4-6 tickets per game)
- Track win rates by type
- Data-driven iteration
- **NEVER combine opposites** (Over/Under split across tickets)
- Multiple win paths per game
