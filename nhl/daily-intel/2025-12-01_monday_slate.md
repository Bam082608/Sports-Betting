| **CBJ @ NJ** | CBJ +1.5 (-200) | CBJ +128 | 5.5 | **SKIP.** NJ defense is elite. Blocks too many shots. |
| **WPG @ BUF** | **WPG +1.5 (-280)** | **-110 (PICK)** | **6.5 (+102)** | **TARGET.** No Hellebuyck (WPG) vs Glass Cannon (BUF). |

## 2. TACTICAL BREAKDOWN

### 🎯 TARGET A: THE "HELLEBUYCK VOID" (WPG @ BUF)
*   **The Line:** Moneyline is a dead even split (-110 / -110). The books know Hellebuyck is OUT.
*   **The Trap:** WPG +1.5 is unbettable at -280.
*   **The Play:** **OVER 6.5 (+102)**.
*   **Logic:** WPG backup goalie (Comrie) + BUF "Glass Cannon" offense = Goals. We get "Plus Money" on the Over. This is the smartest play on the board.

### 🎯 TARGET B: THE "VOLUME KING" (ANA @ STL)
*   **The Line:** Total is 6.5. St. Louis defense is bottom-tier.
*   **The Play:** **Cutter Gauthier SOG Prop (Over 2.5 or 3.5)**.
*   **Logic:** Anaheim is feeding him. St. Louis allows shots. We ignore the game outcome and bet the player.

### 🎯 TARGET C: THE "FROZEN TUNDRA" (NYG @ NE)
*   **The Line:** Total 46.5.
*   **The Intel:** 27°F in Foxborough. Malik Nabers likely OUT/Hurt.
*   **The Play:** **Tyrone Tracy Jr. Rushing Yards**.
*   **Logic:** Cold weather = Run the ball. Giants have no passing game without Nabers.
