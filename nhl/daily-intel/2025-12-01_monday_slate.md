## 1. THE "KILL LIST" (EXECUTABLE BETS)

### 🏒 NHL TARGETS
| Player/Game | Bet | Odds | Viper Analysis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **WPG @ BUF** | **OVER 6.5 Goals** | **+102** | **THE ANCHOR.** No Hellebuyck (WPG) vs. Glass Cannon (BUF). Two backup goalies = Goal Fest. |
| **Cutter Gauthier** | **Over 3.5 SOG** | **+108** | **THE SNIPER.** Averaging 4.2 SOG/g. "Buy Low" spot after playing two elite defenses. STL bleeds shots. |

### 🏈 NFL TARGETS (MNF)
| Player | Bet | Odds | Viper Analysis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tyrone Tracy Jr.** | **Over 69.5 Rush + Rec Yds** | **-112** | **THE BELL COW.** He has hit **130+ yards** in 2 straight games. 69.5 is disrespectful. Weather forces short game. |
| **Tyrone Tracy Jr.** | **Over 2.5 Receptions** | **-125** | **THE CHECK DOWN.** 27°F weather = QB can't throw deep. Tracy is the safety valve. |

*   **WPG Void:** Hellebuyck is OUT. Comrie is IN. WPG defense relies on Hellebuyck to clean up mistakes. Without him, they allow 3-4 goals.
*   **Tracy Surge:** Since taking the starting role, Tracy is averaging **134.5 total yards** in his last two games. The books have not adjusted to his usage.
*   **Gauthier Volume:** 37 shots in last 10 games. Anaheim's entire offense is "Get the kid the puck."
