| **First Shot: DAL** | +104 | 🟢 VALUE - If DAL wins faceoff, plus money |
| **Goal in 1st 5 Mins (NO)** | -215 | Heavy juice = Slow start expected |
| **Goal in 1st 10 Mins (YES)** | -160 | Market expects 1-0 by mid-period |

## 3. THE SHOOTER MATRIX (Volume Analysis)

### FLOOR: 2+ Shots on Goal

| Player | Team | Odds | Risk Level | APEXVIPER Grade |
|--------|------|------|------------|-----------------|
| **Jason Robertson** | DAL | -800 | 🔴 LOCK (Expensive) | Tier 1 Star - Parlay Foundation |
| **Timo Meier** | NJD | -620 | 🔴 LOCK (High Traffic) | High Volume vs Blockers |
| **Dougie Hamilton** | NJD | -370 | Very High | D-man with shooting priority |
| **Mikko Rantanen** | DAL | -290 | High | Tier 1 Star (per Nov logs) |
| **Nico Hischier** | NJD | -290 | High | Top Line Center |
| **Wyatt Johnston** | DAL | -265 | High | Hot hand, verified performer |
| **Jesper Bratt** | NJD | -240 | Moderate | Playmaker, shoots less |
| **Arseny Gritsyuk** | NJD | -215 | 🟡 Rookie Wildcard | Unproven volume |
| **Jamie Benn** | DAL | -110 | ⚪ Coin Flip | Age/role decline |

### CEILING: 3+ Shots on Goal

|--------|------|------|--------------|---------------------|
| **Jason Robertson** | DAL | -230 | Standard | Still expensive but elite volume |

### Volume Intelligence
- **Robertson 2+/3+ Stack:** Foundation play, but expensive (-800/-230)
- **Value Ceiling Cluster:** Hischier/Rantanen/Johnston all +108 to +114 for 3+ SOG
- **Parlay Construction:** Robertson 2+ (-800) + Rantanen 3+ (+110) + Hischier 3+ (+108) = Balanced risk/reward
- **Trap Alert:** Gritsyuk at -215 for 2+ SOG with no NHL volume history
