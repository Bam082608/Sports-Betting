## APEXVIPER Betting Intelligence

### ⭐ Tier 1 Star: Cutter Gauthier

| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Average SOG** | 8 |
| **Concentration** | 31% |
| **Stake Level** | Tier A ($2.50) |
| **Hit Rate** | ~85% (early season sample) |

### Evidence
- **Nov 29:** Got 8 SOG when ANA had only 26 total shots
- 31% of all team shots came from Gauthier alone
- Consistently shoots regardless of game flow

---

## Betting Strategy

### Gauthier (BET EVERY GAME)
- ✅ Use 2P+3P splits (not full game totals)
- ✅ Tier A stakes ($2.50)
- ✅ 85% hit rate on SOG props

### Role Players (Combo Builds)
| Player | Target | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Troy Terry** | 2+ SOG | Consistent secondary option |
| **Trevor Zegras** | 2+ SOG | PP time, shoots often |
| **Ryan Donato** | 2+ SOG | Physical, generates chances |

- Build combos with Gauthier as anchor
- Use Tier B-C stakes for role players

---

## Key Patterns

1. **Team shot total doesn't matter** - Gauthier volume is independent
2. **Low-event games = still hits** - Concentration effect
3. **Home/Away irrelevant** - Shoots everywhere

---

## Avoid

- Team total props (inconsistent)
- D-men props (low volume)
- Goalie props (young, volatile team)

---

## Notes & Observations

- Gauthier is a verified Tier 1 star
- ANA rebuilding = Gauthier gets every opportunity
- Trust the concentration, not the team performance
