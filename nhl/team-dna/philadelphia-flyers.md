# 🟠 PHILADELPHIA FLYERS (Team DNA)
**Defense Grade:** ELITE (Suffocating Grind)
**Key Vulnerability:** "Garbage Goals" (Net-front scrambles).
**Status:** ⚠️ HIGH CAUTION for Shot Props.

## 🛡️ THE NO-FLY ZONE (Do Not Bet Against)
- **Nick Seeler [BLOCKER]:** The "Human Shield." 3+ Blocks/Game. FADE volume shooters against PHI when Seeler is active.
- **Travis Sanheim [LOCKDOWN]:** Eraser of top lines. 25+ mins/game with heavy defensive responsibility.
- **Rasmus Ristolainen [HITMAN]:** Physical separator. Disrupts zone time and punishes rush chances.

## 🎯 TARGETING PROFILE
- **Centers:** 🔴 FADE. (Flyers profile as highly suppressive vs center production / fantasy points).
- **Point Shots (D-Men):** 🟡 CAUTION. High block risk from both defense and forwards.
- **Volume Shooters:** 🔴 FADE. (Flyers tend to hold opponents to low total shot counts).
- **The Only Edge:** Rebound / Garbage goals. Look more to "Anytime Goal" / net-front grinders than raw SOG overs.

## 🚑 INJURY EDGE
- **IF Nick Seeler is OUT:** → UPGRADE opponent shot targets one tier (e.g., FADE → CAUTION, CAUTION → GREEN), subject to line value and other context.
