# 🔵 WINNIPEG JETS (Team DNA)
**Defense Grade:** BROKEN FORTRESS (Critical Injury)  
**Key Vulnerability:** Goaltending Vacuum (Hellebuyck OUT).  
**Status:** 🚨 MAX FADE until Hellebuyck returns.

## 🛡️ THE NO-FLY ZONE
- **Connor Hellebuyck [INJURED]:** The entire defensive system relies on him. Without him, the structure collapses.
- **Eric Comrie [TARGET]:** Backup exposed to high-danger chances. GSAx is negative; not equipped to paper over defensive leaks.

## 🎯 TARGETING PROFILE
- **Opponent Moneyline:** 🟢 GREEN — Fade Winnipeg in almost all matchups while Hellebuyck is out.
- **Game Totals:** 🟢 GREEN — Back the Over 6.0/6.5; defensive trust is gone.
- **Volume Shooters vs WPG:** 🟢 GREEN — Defense cannot consistently bail out the goalie.

## 🚑 INJURY EDGE
- **CRITICAL:** Hellebuyck OUT creates a "Variance Void." Treat Jets as a structurally broken team until he returns and proves form.
