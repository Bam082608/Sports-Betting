# 🔴 CHICAGO BLACKHAWKS (Team DNA)
**Defense Grade:** WEAK (Developmental)  
**Key Vulnerability:** Road Games & Depth Scoring.  
**Status:** 🟡 PROP TARGET ONLY (team results volatile, but individual props viable).

## 🛡️ THE NO-FLY ZONE
- **Sam Rinzel [BLOCKADE]:** 28 Blocks in recent sample. Young defenseman providing defensive value.
- **Petr Mrazek [GRINDER]:** Performs surprisingly well under siege for stretches but eventually breaks under volume.

## 🎯 TARGETING PROFILE
- **Connor Bedard Props:** 🟢 GREEN — Shot volume (85 SOG) and usage (21:15 TOI) are elite. He drives the offense regardless of game state.
- **Frank Nazar:** 🟡 MONITOR — 48 SOG, ~19 mins TOI. Emerging option with good usage.
- **Road Games:** 🔴 FADE — Young roster travels poorly; floor is low.
- **Puck Line (+1.5) at Home:** 🟡 VALUE — Feisty at home, can keep games closer than talent suggests.
