## APEXVIPER Betting Intelligence

### ⭐ Tier 1 Star: Connor Bedard

| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Average SOG** | 5 |
| **Concentration** | 28% |
| **Stake Level** | Tier A ($2.50) |
| **Hit Rate** | ~80% (early season sample) |

### Evidence
- **Nov 29:** Got 5 SOG when CHI had only 18 total shots
- 28% of all team shots came from Bedard alone
- Generational talent with maximum usage

---

## Key Insight

> *"Team shot total doesn't matter, individual volume matters."*

Chicago is a low-event team but Bedard shoots EVERY opportunity. The team struggles to generate offense, but Bedard's usage is elite.

---

## Betting Strategy

### Bedard (BET EVERY GAME)
- ✅ Use 2P+3P splits (not full game totals)
- ✅ Tier A stakes ($2.50)
- ✅ 80% hit rate on SOG props

### Role Players
- ⚠️ **AVOID** - CHI role players have inconsistent volume
- Team too reliant on Bedard
- Low-event games hurt secondary scorers

---

## Key Patterns

1. **Team is terrible, Bedard is elite** - Concentration effect
2. **Low shot totals = Bedard still eats** - 28% concentration
3. **PP1 usage** - Gets every power play opportunity
4. **Volume regardless of score** - Plays through blowouts

---

## Avoid

- ❌ Team total props (very low-event)
- ❌ Role player SOG props (inconsistent)
- ❌ D-men props (CHI doesn't generate)
- ❌ Goalie props (team defense is weak)

---

## Notes & Observations

- Bedard is a verified Tier 1 star
- CHI rebuilding around him = maximum opportunity
- Don't let bad team record scare you off Bedard props
- Trust the player, not the team
