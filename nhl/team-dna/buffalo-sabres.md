# ⚔️ BUFFALO SABRES (Team DNA)
**Defense Grade:** GLASS CANNON (High Risk / Low Structure)  
**Key Vulnerability:** Forecheck Pressure & "Soft" Identity (fold when trailing).  
**Status:** 🟡 VOLATILE (Heavily dependent on Tage Thompson and goaltending mood).

## 🛡️ THE NO-FLY ZONE
- **Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen [VOLATILE]:** Can steal games or implode; consistency is the problem, not talent.

## 🎯 TARGETING PROFILE
- **1st Period Overs:** 🟢 GREEN — Start loose, trade chances early.
- **Home Underdogs:** 🟢 GREEN — Speed can shred tired road teams at home.
- **Live Betting:** 🟢 GREEN — If BUF gives up a lead, look to fade them live; tendency to mentally fold.

## 🚑 INJURY EDGE
- **IF Tage Thompson is OUT:** 🔴 MAX FADE — Offensive ceiling collapses; identity disappears.
