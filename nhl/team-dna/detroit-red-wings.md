# 🔴 DETROIT RED WINGS (Team DNA)
**Defense Grade:** WEAK (High Event / No Structure)  
**Key Vulnerability:** "Trading Chances" — they bleed shots and rush chances.  
**Status:** 🟢 OVER MACHINE + HOME DOG SPECIALIST

## 🛡️ THE NO-FLY ZONE
- **None:** No true shutdown pair. Defense remains porous.

## 🥅 GOALIE HIERARCHY (CONFIRMED Dec 2, 2025)
| Goalie | Record | GAA | SV% | Status |
|--------|--------|-----|-----|--------|
| **Cam Talbot** | **9-4-0** | 2.97 | .887 | ✅ **CLEAR #1** |
| Alex Lyon | Backup | - | - | Spot starts |
| Ville Husso | Out/IR | - | - | Not a factor |

**CRITICAL:** Talbot (9-4-0) >>> Gibson (4-7-1 elsewhere) - Goalie hierarchy ESTABLISHED
- When Talbot starts: DET is competitive
- When backup starts: Fade or target OVER

## 🎯 TARGETING PROFILE
- **Game Totals:** 🟢 BACK OVER 6.0/6.5 — "They score 4, give up 4" archetype.
- **Home Dog:** 🟢 **GIANT KILLER VALUE** — Desperation at home keeps games close and high event.
- **Opponent Shot Props:** 🟢 GREEN — Wide open lanes, especially for attacking D and top lines.
- **DET ML (Home Dog):** 🟢 VALUE — Sharp money backs DET in this spot

## 📈 CURRENT FORM (Dec 2, 2025)
- Talbot providing stability when starting
- High-event team that trades chances
- Home underdog = upset DNA active
- Against injury-depleted opponents = VALUE SPOT

## 🏒 KEY PLAYERS FOR SOG PROPS
| Player | Avg SOG | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Dylan Larkin | 2.5-3.0 | Top line + PP usage, consistent volume |
| Lucas Raymond | ~2.3 | Volume winger, benefits from high-event games |

## BETTING EDGES
- **Back DET Home Dog vs Injured Teams:** BOS without McAvoy = opportunity
- **Talbot Confirmation:** Always verify Talbot is starting before betting DET ML
- **OVER in DET games:** High-event DNA remains active
