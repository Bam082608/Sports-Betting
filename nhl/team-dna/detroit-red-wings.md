# 🔴 DETROIT RED WINGS (Team DNA)

**Key Vulnerability:** "Trading Chances" — they bleed shots and rush chances.  
**Status:** 🟢 OVER MACHINE.

## 🛡️ THE NO-FLY ZONE
- **None:** No true shutdown pair. Goaltending is by committee (Talbot/Husso/Lyon) and highly volatile.

- **Game Totals:** 🟢 BACK OVER 6.0/6.5 — "They score 4, give up 4" archetype.
- **Home Dog:** 🟢 VALUE — Desperation at home keeps games close and high event.
- **Opponent Shot Props:** 🟢 GREEN — Wide open lanes, especially for attacking D and top lines.
