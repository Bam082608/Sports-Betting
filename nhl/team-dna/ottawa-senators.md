# ⚔️ OTTAWA SENATORS (Team DNA)
**Defense Grade:** VOLATILE (Top-Heavy)  
**Key Vulnerability:** Discipline & Backup Goalie Drop-Off.  
**Status:** 🟡 DEPENDENT (Check goaltender before every play).

## 🛡️ THE NO-FLY ZONE
- **Linus Ullmark [SAVIOR]:** Erases a lot of mistakes. If IN, upgrade defensive expectations; if OUT, treat them as a Max Fade candidate.

## 🎯 TARGETING PROFILE
- **Brady Tkachuk Props:** 🟢 GREEN — Bet SOG/Hits especially after a loss; plays angry and drives play.
- **Road Games:** 🔴 FADE — Discipline issues compound on the road; penalties and breakdown risk spike.
- **Backups (Forsberg/Sogaard):** 🟢 BACK OVER — Massive drop-off from Ullmark; target Overs and Opponent Team Totals.
