# Carolina Hurricanes

## Team Overview

## ⚠️ APEXVIPER WARNING: AVOID TEAM

### 🚫 DO NOT BET OPPONENT D-MEN vs CAR

Carolina has **elite shot-blocking** that destroys D-men SOG props for opposing teams.

---

## Evidence

### CGY @ CAR (Nov 29)
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **CGY Total Shots** | 26 |
| **D-Men Props** | ALL FAILED |
| **Props Result** | -$5.69 |
| **Hedge (Under)** | +$6.00 |
| **Net Result** | +$0.31 |

The hedge saved us. Without the Under bet, we would have lost $5.69.

---

## Why CAR Is Dangerous

1. **Elite Shot-Blocking** - Defenders sacrifice bodies
2. **System Defense** - Rod Brind'Amour's structured play
3. **Low Shot Totals Allowed** - Opponents struggle to generate
4. **Physical Play** - Intimidates shooters

---

## Betting Strategy

### When Opponent Plays CAR

| Action | Recommendation |
|--------|----------------|
| **Opponent D-Men** | ❌ SKIP |
| **Opponent Forwards** | ⚠️ Reduce stakes |
| **Under Total Shots** | ✅ BET (hedge) |
| **Skip Entirely** | ✅ Valid option |

---

## CAR Players (Not Recommended)

Carolina has **distributed scoring** - no single player concentrates shots like our Tier 1 stars.

| Player | Issue |
|--------|-------|
| Aho | Shares with Svechnikov |
| Svechnikov | Shares with Aho |
| Kotkaniemi | Inconsistent |

No verified Tier 1 concentration players on Carolina.

---

## Hedge Protocol

When you must bet against CAR:

1. Build D-men props for opponent
2. **Immediately hedge with Under total shots**
3. Accept small loss on props if Under hits
4. Example: -$5.69 props + $5.00 Under = +$0.31 net

## Similar Teams to AVOID for D-Men Props

| Team | Reason |
|------|--------|
| **CAR** | Elite shot-blocking |
| **BOS** | Strong defensive structure |
| **NJ** | Low-event games common |
| **VGK** | Physical, shot-suppressing |

---

## Notes & Observations

- CAR is a AVOID team, not a target
- If opponent plays CAR, use hedge protocol
- Better to skip than force bad bets
- Distributed scoring = no concentration edge
