## Notes & Observations
- **Pettersson's Defense**: Elias Pettersson recording 47 blocks is an outlier stat for a forward—valuable for "defensive plays" or blocked shot props.
- **Shot Distribution**: Kane and DeBrusk are shooting more frequently per minute than some top-line stars.
- **Roster Notes**: 2025 Roster includes Evander Kane and Jake DeBrusk (new additions in this timeline).
