# 🗽 NEW YORK RANGERS (Team DNA)
**Defense Grade:** CRIPPLED (Elite D-Man OUT)  
**Key Vulnerability:** ❌ **ADAM FOX LTIR** until late December  
**Status:** 🔴 **MAX FADE** (as of Dec 2, 2025)

## 🛡️ CURRENT STATE: STRUCTURE COLLAPSED
- **Igor Shesterkin [ELITE BUT FATIGUED]:** 10-9-2, 2.48 GAA, .911 SV% - Carrying heavy load
- **Defense Structure:** Completely compromised without Fox
- **Transition Game:** CRIPPLED - Fox was engine of breakout

## 🎯 TARGETING PROFILE
- **NYR ML:** 🔴 MAX FADE — Fox OUT changes everything
- **NYR PP:** 🔴 FADE — PP quarterback gone
- **Opponent Props:** 🟢 GREEN — Target opponent scoring/transition
- **Over in NYR Games:** 🟡 CONSIDER — Defense gaps open up play

## ⚠️ CRITICAL INJURY UPDATES (Dec 2, 2025)
| Player | Status | Return Date | Impact |
|--------|--------|-------------|--------|
| **Adam Fox** | LTIR | **Late December** | ❌❌❌ MASSIVE - Best D-man, #1 PP QB, transition engine |
| **Jonathan Quick** | OUT | TBD | ❌ No backup = Shesterkin fatigue risk |
| **Matt Rempe** | OUT | TBD | Depth/physicality affected |

## 📉 WHY FOX OUT IS MASSIVE
- **Transition Game:** Fox led all D-men in zone exits and controlled entries
- **Power Play:** #1 PP quarterback - Rangers PP will plummet without him
- **Ice Time Redistribution:** Other D-men forced into expanded roles they can't handle
- **MSG Woes:** Home struggles continue without elite defensive anchor

## BETTING EDGES (FADE APPROACH)
- **Fade NYR at Home:** MSG struggles documented + Fox OUT
- **Back Structured Opponents:** Teams like Dallas will exploit chaos
- **Shesterkin Fatigue Watch:** Quick OUT means no rest option
