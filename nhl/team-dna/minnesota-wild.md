# 🟢 MINNESOTA WILD (Team DNA)
**Defense Grade:** THE TRAP (Elite Structure)  
**Key Vulnerability:** Speed through the Neutral Zone.  
**Status:** 🟢 BACK when Wallstedt starts.

## 🛡️ THE NO-FLY ZONE
- **Jesper Wallstedt [WALL]:** Elite technician. When he starts, lean heavily toward UNDERS and low-event scripts.
- **Joel Eriksson Ek [SHUTDOWN]:** Eraser of top centers; matchup anchor.

## 🎯 TARGETING PROFILE
- **Kirill Kaprizov Props:** 🟢 GREEN — He IS the offense; SOG and points props viable even in trap games.
- **Game Totals:** 🟢 BACK UNDER 5.5 — Expect boring, structured wins.
- **Matchups vs High-Speed Teams (COL, DAL, etc.):** 🔴 FADE — Speed can break the trap and turn games more chaotic.
