# 🧩 APEXVIPER IDEA BUILDER MENU — Dec 02, 2025 (PIT vs PHI)

**Strategy Note:**  
- 🟢 **Green** = Core "Grinder" legs. Combine 2–3 at a time for main tickets.  
- 🟡 **Yellow** = Value adds. Use 0–1 of these per ticket to improve odds.  
- 🔴 **Red** = Fades / unders. Either bet opposite the public or avoid entirely.  
- 🔵 **Blue** = Lotto shots. $0.25–$1 "dam burst" or garbage goal scenarios.

Agents reading this file must cross‑check:
- `nhl/team-dna/philadelphia-flyers.md` (Philly DNA: Fade Centers, Seeler [BLOCKER]).
- `research/2025-12-02-slate-data.md` (Tonight's odds + averages board).

## 🟢 TIER 1: THE "GRINDER" FOUNDATION (Safe 2+ Shot Targets)

These are primarily wingers (avoiding the center blockade vs PHI) or established volume shooters. Intended as **core legs** for 2+ SOG markets.

- Owen Tippett (PHI) 2+ Shots (-280) – The Lock. High-volume winger; shoots from everywhere.
- Bryan Rust (PIT) 2+ Shots (-230) – Winger role avoids the center blockade; consistent volume.
- Travis Konecny (PHI) 2+ Shots (-192) – Safe floor vs weak Penguins defense and leaky goaltending.
- Tyson Foerster (PHI) 2+ Shots (-165) – **Best value** on the board; averages ~1.95 SOG.
- Matvei Michkov (PHI) 2+ Shots (-184) – Rookie is hot; Penguins give up space and chances.
- Rickard Rakell (PIT) 2+ Shots (Check Status) – If IN, long‑term volume shooter profile.
- Anthony Beauvillier (PIT) 2+ Shots (around Even) – Sneaky recent volume; often benefits from playing with Sid.
- Reilly Smith (NYR or other slate games) – Use as a template for similar winger profiles in other matchups.
- Joel Farabee (PHI) 2+ Shots – Streaky, but benefits from porous Penguins defensive structure.
- Travis Sanheim (PHI) 2+ Shots – D‑man joining the rush against soft Pens coverage.

## 🟡 TIER 2: THE VALUE PLAYS (1.5+ Lines or Specific Angles)

Good odds and statistically backed, but with a bit more role or variance risk. Best used to **boost payout** on otherwise safe stacks.

- Tyson Foerster (PHI) Over 1.5 Shots (standard line) – Same thesis as Grinder leg; line is still soft.
- Erik Karlsson (PIT) Over 1.5 Shots (-144) – Volume not elite lately but 1.5 is low; game script can force him to shoot.
- Kris Letang (PIT) Over 1.5 Shots (-110) – Better value than Karlsson in many books; usage + PP time.
- Sean Couturier (PHI) Over 1.5 Shots (often plus money) – Top-line minutes, but some pass‑first tendencies.
- Morgan Frost (PHI) Over 1.5 Shots – More of a playmaker, but Penguins allow overall volume.
- Michael Bunting (PIT) Over 1.5 Shots – Net-front presence; "garbage shot" opportunities.
- Drew O'Connor (PIT) Over 1.5 Shots – Big body; jams the net, can spike volume in certain game scripts.
- Cam York (PHI) Over 1.5 Shots – Young D‑man trending up in shot attempts.
- Marcus Pettersson (PIT) Over 0.5 or 1.5 Shots – Look for soft 0.5 or plus‑money 1+ lines.
- Scott Laughton (PHI) Over 1.5 Shots – Grinder energy; can spike shots when lines are rolling.

## 🔴 TIER 3: THE "TRAP" FADES (Unders or Avoid Completely)

Players walking into the **No-Fly Zone** (Centers vs Philly's structure) or in bad situational/form spots. These are either **Under** candidates or "do not chase the over" warnings.

- Sidney Crosby (PIT) UNDER 3.5 Shots – Philly kills Centers; Seeler [BLOCKER] + Sanheim [LOCKDOWN] make this expensive.
- Evgeni Malkin (PIT) UNDER 2.5 Shots – Aging, tougher matchup; center lane is structurally hostile.
- Ben Kindel (PIT) UNDER 2.5 Shots – Rookie center trap vs Philly's defensive DNA; avoid over ladders.
- Kevin Hayes (PIT) UNDER 1.5 Shots – Low volume, depth role; minutes/stimulus not ideal.
- Ryan Poehling (PHI) UNDER 1.5 Shots – Defensive forward; shoots rarely, usage skewed to PK/defense.
- Garnet Hathaway (PHI) UNDER 1.5 Shots – Hitter/energy forward; not a shot‑volume play.
- Rasmus Ristolainen (PHI) UNDER 1.5 Shots (if in) – Defense‑first deployment; focus on hits/blocks over shots.
- Any PIT 4th liner UNDER 0.5 Shots – Expect low ice time in a grind game script.
- Jesse Puljujarvi (PIT) UNDER 1.5 Shots – Inconsistent minutes and role; fragile volume.
- Noel Acciari (PIT) UNDER 1.5 Shots – Pure defensive/PK role; historically low shot rates.

## 🔵 TIER 4: THE LOTTO TICKETS ($0.25–$1 Moonshots)

High variance, "Dam Burst" or "Garbage Goal" plays. Use these as small‑stake fun tickets, not core bankroll positions.

- Owen Tippett (PHI) 4+ Shots (+180 range) – If anyone hits 4+, Tippett is the prime candidate.
- Tyson Foerster (PHI) Anytime Goal (+200 range) – Sniper vs Jarry; benefits from weak goaltending.
- Michael Bunting (PIT) Anytime Goal (+350 range) – Garbage goal specialist; net-front chaos.
- Bryan Rust (PIT) 4+ Shots – If Penguins chase the game, Rust shoots a ton.
- Travis Sanheim (PHI) Anytime Goal (+700 range) – Longshot D‑man scoring; rush activation angle.
- Nick Seeler (PHI) 3+ Blocked Shots – "Human Shield" outcome; structural shot suppression.
- Kris Letang (PIT) 3+ Blocked Shots – Eats pucks on PK and in defensive zone.
- Parlay: Tippett 4+ Shots / Rust 3+ Shots – High-usage volume correlation.
- Parlay: Foerster Goal / Bunting Goal – "Garbage Goal Special" correlation in high‑event sequences.
- Correct Score: PHI 3–1 or 3–2 – Grind game script where Philly controls, but does not blow out.

## 🥅 TIER 5: GOALIE & GAME PROPS (Hedges and Script Bets)

These are used to hedge shot‑prop exposure and to express your core game script derived from Team DNA.

- Dan Vladar (PHI) UNDER 28.5 Saves – Expect Pens to struggle to get 30+ shots through Seeler/Sanheim structure.
- Tristan Jarry (PIT) OVER 26.5 Saves – Philly shooters (Tippett, etc.) generate volume; Jarry sees plenty of rubber.
- Game Total UNDER 6.0 – Philly DNA = grind; center suppression + shot blocking caps ceiling.
- Game Total UNDER 6.5 (Alt Line) – Safer hedge for lower‑volatility exposure.
- Period 1 UNDER 1.5 Goals – Feeling‑out process angle; structure beats chaos early.
- No Goal First 10 Minutes – Classic slow‑burn Philly script.
- Flyers Moneyline – Fade Jarry and leverage Philly's structural edge.
- Penguins Team Total UNDER 2.5 – "Seeler block" on central offense pathways.
- Both Teams to Score: YES – Jarry is leaky enough for Philly; Pens can still break through once.
- Race to 3 Goals: Flyers – If any team reaches 3, Philly's structure + volume edge makes them the favorite.

## 🧠 STRATEGY REMINDER FOR AGENTS

- Primary core builds should use:
  - 2–3 ideas from **Tier 1 (Green Grinder)**, and
  - Optionally 0–1 idea from **Tier 2 (Yellow Value)**.
- **Never** build a core ticket around Tier 3 (Red) or Tier 4 (Blue) ideas.
  - Red = hedge / under / avoid.
  - Blue = lotto only (small stakes).
