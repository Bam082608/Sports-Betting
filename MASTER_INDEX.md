**Key Rules:**
- ❌ Never bet game totals (O/U 6.5, 5.5, etc.)
- ✅ Always use team-specific totals
- ✅ Favorite Over X.5 / Underdog Under Y.5
- ✅ VGK/PHI proof of concept (12/11/25)

**The 3-2 Template:**
```
Leg 1: Favorite Over 1.5 (they score 2-3)
Leg 2: Underdog Under 3.5 (they stay quiet)
Leg 3: Puck line (optional structure)
```

**Rationale:** 4 documented game total failures vs 0 team total failures

- **Profit boost maximum: $5** (NEW)
- Daily limit: 10-15 units ($25-37.50)

**Updated Sections (12/12/25):**
- 🐴 "Too Absurd" Principle (NEW)
- 🎭 Detachment strategies
- 🚨 Tilt detection (4 levels)
- 💪 Resilience protocols
- 🎓 Advanced techniques

**Key Insight:**
> Mental game > Analytical edge. Billy's $40 → $600 wasn't superior analysis, it was superior discipline.

**Four Horsemen Proof:**
- Event: 4 hook losses in one night
- Expected response: Tilt, rage, -$200 chase
- Billy's response: Laughter, zero tilt, -$62.50 only
- **This is the edge**

---

### PROMOTION PSYCHOLOGY (NEW)
**File:** `PROTOCOLS/PROMOTION_PSYCHOLOGY.md`
**Priority:** HIGH - Protect against boost traps

**The Rule:**
- **Maximum boost stake: $5**
- Applies to ALL boosts (25%, 50%, 100%)
- Only use within system expertise (NHL)
- "Let it expire" = smart discipline

**The Trap:**
```
FanDuel gives: 25% "free" boost
Bettor thinks: "I should maximize this"
Bettor bets: $25 (10X normal stake)
Bettor loses: -$25 vs normal -$2.50
Result: Book wins $22.50 extra
```

**Case Study:** December 11th NBA loss (-$50)

---

### CHALK PARLAY ECONOMICS (NEW)
**File:** `PROTOCOLS/CHALK_PARLAY_ECONOMICS.md`
**Priority:** HIGH - Avoid public traps

**The Rule:**
- ⚠️ Maximum ONE chalk leg (-200+) per parlay
- ❌ Never 3+ team all-chalk parlays
- ✅ Mix favorites with spreads/underdogs

**The Math:**
```
Three 76% favorites:
├─ Combined probability: 45%
├─ At least one upset: 52%
└─ Your "safe" parlay: Coin flip
```

**Case Study:** Rockets/Celtics/Nuggets parlay
- All heavy favorites (-313, -316, -370)
- Public: 85-90% on all three
- Result: Celtics upset killed thousands of parlays
- Books: Massive profit night
