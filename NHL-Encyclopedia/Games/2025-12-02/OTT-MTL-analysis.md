### 2. FAST MONEY: EARLY PERIOD PROPS

#### 2.1. Goal in First 5 Minutes

- **YES +164**
  - Implied Probability: **37.9%**
  - Surveillance Note: High risk, but offers decent payout for a chaotic start.

- **NO -215**
  - Implied Probability: **68.3%**
  - Surveillance Note: The "safe boring bet"; market expects more often no goal than goal in first 5.

**Interpretation:**  
Market leans toward a relatively controlled first 5 minutes, but the YES side has meaningful upside if either defense collapses early.

---

#### 2.2. Goal in First 10 Minutes

- **YES -160**
  - Implied Probability: **61.5%**
  - Surveillance Note: Books expect a goal in the first half of the 1st period.

- **NO +126**
  - Implied Probability: **44.2%**
  - Surveillance Note: Contrarian angle; betting on a slow, defensive start.

**Interpretation:**  
Lines imply **no goal in first 5** is favored, but a **goal before 10:00** is also favored. Game script expectation:  
- First 5 minutes: moderate caution.  
- 5–10 minute window: higher likelihood of breakdown or power play triggering the first goal.

- **Tier:** **Tier 2 – Offensive Defenseman (If PP Usage Confirmed)**  
- **Rationale:** 1+ point at -154 is notable for a defenseman; suggests PP or key offensive role.  
- **Usage:**  
  - 1+ point as a niche correlation leg in MTL power-play-driven stacks.

---

##### Zachary Bolduc – MTL

- **1+ Point Odds:** +108  
- **Goal Odds:** +290 → Goal Prob: **25.6%**  
- **2+ Shots Odds:** -132

  - 3+ shots +310 for long-odds builds.

---

##### Ivan Demidov – MTL

- **1+ Point Odds:** +122  
- **Goal Odds:** +370 → Goal Prob: **21.3%**  

**Tier & Role:**

- **Usage:**  
  - High-variance SGP leg only.

---

### 4. DEFENSIVE & GOALTENDING BLOCKADE

#### 4.1. Goalie Intel

**Linus Ullmark – OTT**

- GP: 19 | Record: 9–6–4  
- GAA: **3.10**  
- SV%: **.874**  
- Total Saves: 417  

**Interpretation:**  
- Below-ideal save percentage; goals against rate suggests opportunity for Montreal shooters/points.

---

**Samuel Montembeault – MTL**

- GP: 13 | Record: 5–5–1  
- GAA: **3.49**  
- SV%: **.864**  
- Total Saves: 260  

**Interpretation:**  
- Even weaker SV% and higher GAA; Ottawa skaters have viable scoring upside.

---

**Jakub Dobes – MTL**

- GP: 13 | Record: 8–3–2  
- GAA: **3.22**  
- SV%: **.888**  
- Total Saves: 316  

**Interpretation:**  
- Slightly better SV% than Montembeault; still not elite.  
- Ottawa shooters (Tkachuk, Pinto, Stützle, Batherson) have pathways to success.

---

#### 4.2. Ottawa Shot Blockers

High-volume shot blockers that can reduce shot props for opponents:

- **Jake Sanderson:** 45 blocks – **High-volume blocker**
- **Tyler Kleven:** 39 blocks
- **Artem Zub:** 38 blocks
- **Thomas Chabot:** 36 blocks (currently **Inactive – Injured**)
- **Nick Jensen:** 24 blocks

**Implications:**

- Ottawa's defense, when healthy, **suppresses shot counts** via blocks, particularly from Sanderson and Zub.  
- With Chabot out, structure is weakened; but remaining top D still materially impact opponent SOG distribution.

> Montreal block stats were unavailable in the intel packet.

---

### 5. CASUALTY REPORT (INJURIES & IMPACT)

#### 5.1. Ottawa Senators

- **Thomas Chabot – Upper Body – IR**
  - Expected Return: Unknown  
  - Impact: **High (Top Defender)**  
  - Effect:  
    - Reduces Ottawa's defensive stability and breakout efficiency.  
    - Potentially increases opponent offensive quality and SOG, but also redistributes TOI to Sanderson/Zub.

---

#### 5.2. Montreal Canadiens

- **Patrik Laine – Abdomen – IR**
  - Expected Return: Feb 28, 2026  
  - Impact: **Critical (Top Sniper)**  
  - Effect:  
    - Removes a major finishing weapon; slightly elevates shot/goal opportunities for remaining top-6 and PP shooters (Caufield, Suzuki, Slafkovsky, etc.).

- **Kirby Dach – Foot – IR**
  - Expected Return: Dec 28, 2025  
  - Impact: **Critical (Top Center)**  
  - Effect:  
    - Weakens down-the-middle play; affects PP and even-strength scoring chains.

- **Alex Newhook – Ankle – IR**
  - Expected Return: Mar 17, 2026  
  - Impact: **High (Top 6 Forward)**  
  - Effect:  
    - Shrinks middle-six scoring depth; concentrates more responsibility on Caufield/Suzuki/Slafkovsky.

- **Kaiden Guhle – Lower Body – IR**
  - Expected Return: Jan 08, 2026  
  - Impact: **High (Top Defender)**  
  - Effect:  
    - Weakens defensive core; can lead to higher-quality chances against and elevated shooting opportunities for Ottawa forwards.

- **Jayden Struble – Upper Body – DTD**
  - Status: Questionable on Dec 02  
  - Impact: **Depth**  
  - Effect:  
    - Marginal effect; depth rotation.

**Global Impact:**  
Montreal is **significantly injury-weakened** (Laine, Dach, Newhook, Guhle). This can create:
- Higher load on Caufield and Suzuki (more usage, more props opportunity).
- Structural defensive vulnerabilities (good for Ottawa shooters and point props).

---

### 6. VALUE SIGNALS & EMERGING ANGLES

**Offensive Environment:**

- Both sides have **sub-elite goaltending metrics** (GAA >3.0, SV% <.890 across goalies).  
- Montreal injuries increase the volatility and dependency on remaining scorers.

**Emerging Value/Focus Points:**

1. **Brady Tkachuk (OTT)** – 4.00 SOG/game (small sample, but elite volume)
   - Use as Tier 1 shooter when healthy confirmation and ice-time context support it.
   - 2+ shots is automatic; 3+ shots likely to be an anchor when lines allow.

2. **Cole Caufield (MTL)** – Goal Prob ~39.2%
   - Core Montreal sniper; 3+ SOG at -140 and anytime goal +155 are key legs in MTL scoring scripts.

3. **Nick Suzuki (MTL)** – 1+ point at -290
   - Expensive but suggests **very high point probability**.
   - Best used as **correlation** in MTL stacks rather than solo plays.

4. **Shane Pinto / Tim Stützle / Drake Batherson (OTT)**
   - All present **strong goal probabilities** and points totals:
     - Stützle: 11G/23P in 25 GP, goal +210.  
     - Pinto: 12G/18P in 25 GP, goal +270.  
     - Batherson: 8G/21P in 22 GP, goal +240.  
   - Ideal for Ottawa goal/point combos and SGP ladders.

5. **Noah Dobson / Dylan Cozens Team-Tags**
   - Data integrity issue: treat "MTL" or "OTT" tags as suspect.
   - Require independent roster verification before using team-based logic in models.

---

### 7. SYSTEM TAGS & FUTURE ENTRIES

**For the Encyclopedia System:**

- **Ottawa Senators Team Profile**
  - Tag Tkachuk as **potential Tier 1 shooter** (pending broader sample).  
  - Mark Stützle, Pinto, Batherson as **Tier 2 offensive engines**.  
  - Document Sanderson as **high TOI offensive D + high shot-blocker**, dual impact.

- **Montreal Canadiens Team Profile**
  - Tag Caufield as **Tier 1 sniper**.  
  - Tag Suzuki as **Tier 2 primary facilitator with elite point probability**.  
  - Mark injuries (Laine, Dach, Newhook, Guhle) as structural constraints for the 2025–26 season.

- **Data Integrity Rule:**
  - Any player with anomalous team tagging (e.g., Cozens/ Dobson under OTT/MTL) must be **validated against roster** and either:
    - Corrected,
    - Or flagged and excluded from team-based modeling.

**Next Steps for Ticket Construction (Not Executed Here):**

- Build a **ticket schema** similar to DAL @ NYR:
  - Foundation: Stars like Tkachuk SOG, Caufield SOG/points (after confirming broader season data).
  - Value: Ottawa points/goals (Pinto, Stützle, Batherson) vs. weakened MTL defense.
  - Lottery: Depth scorers and D-men goals (Sanderson, Gallagher, Bolduc).
  - Hedge: Totals or alternative game scripts (e.g., low-event first 10 minutes vs. full-game over).
