## 🎯 Planned Features

### When NFL System Becomes Active

The NFL system will mirror the successful NHL architecture:

**1. Team DNA System (32 Teams)**
```
Similar to NHL team-dna/, each NFL team will have:
- Offensive system analysis (passing/rushing tendencies)
- Defensive structure (coverage schemes, front seven)
- Coaching tendencies (situational play-calling)
- Home/away splits
- Weather impact profiles
- Divisional game performance
- Key player dependencies
```

**2. Player Tier System**
```
NFL-Specific Tier Categories:
- QB Tier 1: Elite QBs (passing yards/TDs consistency)
- RB Tier 1: Volume backs (rushing + receiving targets)
- WR Tier 1: Target share kings (8+ targets/game)
- TE Tier 1: Consistent red zone threats
- Defense/Special Teams: Turnover generators
```

**3. Situational Edge Protocols**
```
NFL-Specific Edges:
- Weather impact (wind, rain, snow on totals)
- Division game tendencies (defensive slugfests)
- Primetime performance splits
- Revenge game narratives
- Lookahead/letdown spots
- Short week (Thursday games) analysis
```

**4. Surveillance & Tools**
```
NFL Surveillance Would Include:
- Weather monitoring dashboards
- Injury report trackers (practice participation)
- Line movement surveillance (sharper than NHL)
- Prop market comparisons
- DFS correlation analysis
```

## 📋 NFL Macro Framework

### APEXVIPER_NFL_MACRO.md Overview

**File:** `protocols/APEXVIPER_NFL_MACRO.md`  
**Size:** 3,573 bytes  
**Status:** Framework documented, not operationalized

**Key Sections in Framework:**

1. **NFL-Specific Analysis Factors**
   - Weather impact quantification
   - Rest/short week adjustments
   - Coaching tendencies
   - Injury impact (more significant than NHL)

2. **Market Differences vs NHL**
   - Sharper lines (harder to find edge)
   - More public money (casual NFL bettors)
   - Injury news impact magnified
   - Week-to-week variance higher

3. **Situational Spots**
   - Division games (familiarity, defensive focus)
   - Revenge games (narrative-driven)
   - Primetime performance (public spotlight)
   - Weather games (over/under impact)

4. **Prop Market Approach**
   - QB passing yards (volume-based)
   - RB rushing yards (game script dependent)
   - WR receptions (target share focus)
   - Anytime TD scorers (red zone usage)

## 🚧 Why NFL is Currently Placeholder

### Strategic Reasons

**1. Focus Maintenance**
```
APEXVIPER Philosophy: Master one sport before expanding

Current Focus: NHL (Primary operational theater)
- 82-game season provides ample betting opportunities
- Daily slates keep system active
- Player props market aligns with analytical approach
```

**2. Resource Allocation**
```
NHL System Requires:
- Daily analysis (82-game season)
- Continuous protocol refinement
- Ongoing team DNA updates
- Pattern recognition and tracking

Adding NFL Would:
- Dilute focus across two sports
- Require parallel tracking systems
- Strain time/bandwidth resources
- Risk both systems being mediocre vs. one excellent
```

**3. Market Differences**
```
NFL Challenges:
- Much sharper lines than NHL (harder edges)
- Higher public betting volume (more efficient market)
- Weekly games (less sample size for patterns)
- Injury impact more significant (analysis complexity)
- Weather variability (additional factor)

Strategy: Master NHL first, then apply lessons to NFL
```

**4. Institutional Knowledge**
```
Current Priority:
- Build NHL institutional knowledge (COMPLETE-LESSONS-LEARNED.md)
- Establish proven protocols
- Develop reliable edge-finding methods
- Create systematic approach

Future Application:
- Apply proven NHL methods to NFL
- Avoid making same mistakes twice
- Leverage multi-AI collaboration experience
```
