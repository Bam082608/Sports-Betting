# 🧠 PROMOTION PSYCHOLOGY & THE BOOST TRAP

**STATUS:** CRITICAL WARNING
**LESSON LEARNED:** December 11, 2025 (-$50 Loss)

## 1. THE TRAP DEFINED
Sportsbooks do not give "Profit Boosts" (e.g., +25% winnings) to help you. They issue them to disrupt your **Unit Sizing** and **System Discipline**.

### The Mechanism:
1.  **The Bait:** "Here is a 25% boost!"
2.  **The Trigger:** User feels obligated to "maximize" the value.
3.  **The Error:** User increases stake from Standard Unit ($2-5) to Max Allowed ($25).
4.  **The Drift:** User bets on sports/markets outside their core competency to use the token.
5.  **The Result:** User loses 10x their normal stake.

## 2. THE NEW PROTOCOL

### Rule A: The Unit Size Constant
**"A Profit Boost never changes the Stake Size."**
* If your system bet is $5, you bet $5 with the boost.
* The Boost is a "Cherry on top," not the cake.

### Rule B: The "Let It Expire" Principle
It is **PROFITABLE** to let a boost expire if no setup fits your system.
* Unused Boost = $0 Loss.
* Forced Bet on Bad Setup = -$25 Loss.
* **Discipline > FOMO.**

### Rule C: System Loyalty
Never use a boost on a sport you are not currently tracking/analyzing (e.g., betting NBA just because the boost is NBA-specific, while focusing on NHL).

## 3. MAXIMUM EXPOSURE
* **Maximum Stake on ANY Boosted Bet:** $5.00
* **Exception:** None.
