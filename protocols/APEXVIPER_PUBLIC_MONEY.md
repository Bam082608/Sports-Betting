# 📊 APEXVIPER PUBLIC MONEY INTELLIGENCE v1.0
**Owner:** Project Lead (Bam082608)  
**Directive:** Identify and exploit public betting patterns.

## 1. THE "TAX TEAM" CONCEPT
**The Law:** Certain teams attract disproportionate public money, creating inflated lines.

### NHL Tax Teams (Public Overvalues)
| Team | Why Public Loves Them |
|------|----------------------|
| **TOR** | Maple Leafs - Large fanbase, media darling |
| **EDM** | Oilers - McDavid/Draisaitl star power |
| **NYR** | Rangers - New York market, recent success |
| **COL** | Avalanche - Recent Cup winner prestige |
| **VGK** | Golden Knights - Flashy brand, consistent |
| **WSH** | Capitals - Ovechkin legacy betting |
| **MTL** | Canadiens - Historic franchise, loyal bettors |

### NFL Tax Teams (Public Overvalues)
| Team | Why Public Loves Them |
|------|----------------------|
| **DAL** | Cowboys - "America's Team" phenomenon |
| **KC** | Chiefs - Mahomes bandwagon effect |
| **SF** | 49ers - Consistent contender status |
| **PHI** | Eagles - Recent Super Bowl appearance |

## 2. THE 70% THRESHOLD
**The Law:** When >70% of public money is on one side, consider the opposite.

**Why It Works:**
- Books shade lines to attract balanced action
- Sharp money often opposes heavy public sides
- Market inefficiency creates value on the other side

**Reverse Line Movement (RLM):**
- **Definition:** Line moves AGAINST the heavily bet side
- **Signal:** Sharps loading opposite position
- **Action:** Follow the line movement, not the public %

**Example:**
```
Scenario: 75% of bets on Cowboys -7
Line Movement: Cowboys -7 → Cowboys -6.5

Analysis: Line dropped DESPITE heavy Cowboys action
Signal: Sharp money on opponent
Action: Consider opponent +6.5
```

## 3. APPLICATION STRATEGY

### When to Fade Public
- [ ] Public % exceeds 70% on one side
- [ ] Line movement opposes public position (RLM)
- [ ] Tax team involved (inflated lines expected)
- [ ] Prime time game (casual bettor overload)
- [ ] Narrative-driven spot (revenge, streak, etc.)

### When NOT to Fade Public
- [ ] Public aligns with sharp indicators
- [ ] Line movement confirms public position
- [ ] Fundamental edge exists (injury, weather)
- [ ] Public % is moderate (50-65%)

---

## 4. DATA SOURCES

### Primary Sources
- **Action Network:** Public betting %
- **Covers.com:** Line movement tracking
- **VSiN:** Sharp vs public analysis
- **Twitter/X:** Beat reporters for injury/lineup

### What to Track
1. Opening line vs current line
2. Public betting % (bets and $$$)
3. Reverse line movement signals
4. Sharp money indicators

---

## 5. NHL-SPECIFIC PUBLIC PATTERNS

### Overbet Situations
- Home favorites on national TV
- Teams on winning streaks (3+)
- Star player returns from injury
- Playoff positioning games (late season)

### Underbet Situations (Value Targets)
- Road underdogs against tax teams
- Back-to-back scheduling (public assumes fade)
- Teams coming off bad loss (public overreacts)
- Non-glamour teams with solid metrics

---

## 6. NFL-SPECIFIC PUBLIC PATTERNS

### Overbet Situations
- Primetime favorites
- Teams with popular QBs (Mahomes, Allen, etc.)
- Revenge game narratives
- Teams with flashy offenses

### Underbet Situations (Value Targets)
- Road dogs with strong defense
- Teams after bye weeks (public forgets)
- Non-market teams (Green Bay, Cincinnati, etc.)
- Teams with "boring" game plans

---

## 🎯 ACTION ITEMS

### Daily Checklist
- [ ] Check public betting % 2-3 hours before game
- [ ] Identify any RLM signals
- [ ] Note which tax teams are in action
- [ ] Cross-reference with macro intelligence
- [ ] Document public patterns in research files

### Integration Points
- Apply before `APEXVIPER_NFL_MACRO.md` laws
- Cross-reference with `APEXVIPER_PORTFOLIO_CONSTRUCTION.md` sizing
- Document results in `research/public-money-tracking.md` (future)

## 7. THE CONTRARIAN FORMULA

```
Contrarian Value Score = 
  (Public % - 50) × Line Movement Direction × Tax Team Multiplier

Where:
- Public % > 70 = Strong signal
- Line Movement Direction: +1 (against public) or -1 (with public)
- Tax Team Multiplier: 1.2 (if tax team) or 1.0 (standard)

Score > 15: Strong fade signal
Score 10-15: Moderate fade consideration
Score < 10: Insufficient edge
```
