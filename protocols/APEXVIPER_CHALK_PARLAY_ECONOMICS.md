# 📉 CHALK PARLAY ECONOMICS

**STATUS:** DO NOT BET
**CONTEXT:** The "Public Fade" and the ML Parlay Fallacy.

## 1. THE MATH OF HEAVY FAVORITES
Bettors love parlaying heavy favorites (e.g., -300, -400) to get "Better Odds."

**The Trap:**
* **True Win Probability of -350 Favorite:** ~75-78%.
* **The Parlay Math (3 Teams):** 0.78 * 0.78 * 0.78 = **47%**
* **The Payout:** Usually priced around +100 to +120 (Implied 45-50%).
* **The Reality:** You are flipping a coin but risking 3 separate failure points.

## 2. THE PUBLIC CONCENTRATION
When >90% of the public money is on a Moneyline (e.g., Celtics ML vs Bucks), the Books need an upset to clear their liabilities.
* **Result:** Books heavily exposed on the favorite.
* **Outcome:** Upsets happen in the NBA ~30% of the time.
* **Effect:** One upset kills 100% of the "Safe" parlays.

## 3. THE PROTOCOL
**NEVER PARLAY MONEYLINES WORSE THAN -200.**

**Better Alternatives:**
1.  **Spread Betting:** Take the underdog + points (e.g., Bucks +9).
2.  **Spider Web:** Bet the favorites individually if you must, but never link them.
3.  **The Fade:** If 3 heavy favorites are on the board, assume one will lose.
