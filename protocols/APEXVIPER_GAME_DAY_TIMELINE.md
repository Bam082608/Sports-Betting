## PHASE 4: LIVE MONITORING (7:00 PM - Game End)

### During Games

**Check-In Schedule (set timers):**
| Time | Action |
|------|--------|
| End of 1st Period | Check prop progress, evaluate hedge need |
| End of 2nd Period | Final hedge decision point |
| 3rd Period | Monitor only, no action unless pre-planned |

### Live Hedge Decision Tree

```
Is my main ticket at significant risk?
│
├── NO → Continue monitoring, no action
│
└── YES → Check hedge opportunity
         │
         ├── Hedge available at good odds?
         │   ├── YES → Place hedge (max 50% of original stake)
         │   └── NO → Accept risk, no action
         │
         └── Is loss within daily stop-loss?
             ├── YES → Accept outcome
             └── NO → This shouldn't happen (risk management failed)
```

### What NOT to Do During Games
- ❌ Chase losses with new bets
- ❌ Add to positions impulsively
- ❌ Bet on games you didn't analyze
- ❌ Exceed daily risk limits

## ADHD-FRIENDLY TIPS

### Task Chunking Rules
1. **Hard time limits** - Use timers, stop when they ring
2. **One task at a time** - Don't jump between phases
3. **Mandatory breaks** - Non-negotiable disconnects
4. **Decision gates** - Clear yes/no checkpoints
5. **Stop points** - Know when to stop analyzing

### Avoiding Analysis Paralysis
- Max 4 games analyzed per night
- Max 15 minutes per game
- If unsure, move on (don't force bets)
- "Good enough" analysis beats perfect paralysis

### Timer Suggestions
Set phone/watch alarms for:
- 10:30 AM (end slate overview)
- 11:15 AM (end goalie intel)
- 12:00 PM (mandatory break starts)
- 2:00 PM (Phase 2 starts)
- 4:00 PM (mandatory break starts)
- 5:00 PM (Phase 3 starts)
- 6:30 PM (bet placement deadline)
