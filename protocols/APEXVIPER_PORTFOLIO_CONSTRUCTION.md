# 💰 APEXVIPER PORTFOLIO CONSTRUCTION v1.0
**Owner:** Project Lead (Bam082608)  
**Directive:** Build diversified betting portfolios using the Pyramid approach.

---

## 1. THE TITANIC RULE
**The Law:** Never load too many eggs in one basket.

**Bad Example (What NOT to do):**
```
❌ WRONG - All bets on one game:
- Panthers ML: $10
- Panthers -1.5: $10  
- Panthers Team Total Over: $10
- Panthers Player Props (3 legs): $15
- Panthers Same Game Parlay: $10

TOTAL EXPOSURE: $55 on ONE game outcome
```

**Why This Fails:**
- One bad game = catastrophic loss
- No diversification across slate
- Correlated risk (all bets sink together)
- "Titanic Problem" - if the ship sinks, everything goes down

---

## 2. THE CORRECT APPROACH
**The Law:** Spread exposure across multiple independent outcomes.

**Good Example (Proper Construction):**
```
✅ CORRECT - Diversified across slate:
- Game 1 Props: $5
- Game 2 Props: $5
- Game 3 Props: $5
- Cross-Game Parlay (3 games): $5
- Hedge Position: $3

TOTAL EXPOSURE: $23 across MULTIPLE games
```

**Why This Works:**
- One bad game ≠ total loss
- Independent outcomes reduce correlation
- Foundation covers pyramid structure
- Hedge protects against worst case

---

## 3. THE PYRAMID LOGIC

**Standard Ticket Types:**  
See [TICKET-ARSENAL-v2.md](/playbook/TICKET-ARSENAL-v2.md) for complete library of tested betting structures including:
- The Anchor (foundation)
- Volume Stack (offensive exploitation)
- Mirror (hedge strategy)
- Black Swan (insurance)
- God Mode (lottery)
- Superstar Ladder (elite targeting)
- Specialist (depth scoring)
- Time-Hedged Anchor (experimental)

### Foundation (60-70% of exposure)
**Purpose:** Stable, high-probability bets.
- Single-game props on verified stars
- Low correlation between bets
- Higher confidence, lower variance

### Layers (20-30% of exposure)
**Purpose:** Moderate risk/reward.
- 2-3 leg parlays across games
- Cross-game combinations
- Medium correlation plays

### Apex (5-10% of exposure)
**Purpose:** High reward, acceptable loss.
- Large parlays (4+ legs)
- "God tickets"
- Full acceptance that these will lose often

---

## 4. SPORT-SPECIFIC APPLICATIONS

### NHL Application
**Foundation:** Tier 1 star 2P+3P splits ($2.50 each)
**Layers:** Cross-game D-men parlays ($1.25 each)
**Apex:** 5+ leg combinations ($0.25-$0.50)
**Hedge:** Under totals when 5+ props same game

### NFL Application
**Foundation:** High-confidence single props ($5-10 each)
**Layers:** 2-game parlays across slate ($3-5 each)
**Apex:** Multi-game SGPs ($1-2 each)
**Hedge:** Opposite side positions when heavily exposed

---

## 5. THE CORRELATION MATRIX

### High Correlation (AVOID stacking)
- Same team, same game, same outcome dependency
- Example: Team ML + Team spread + Team total over

### Low Correlation (SAFE to combine)
- Different teams, different games
- Example: Player A props (Game 1) + Player B props (Game 2)

### Negative Correlation (HEDGE opportunities)
- Opposite outcomes that offset
- Example: Props over + Game under

---

## 🎯 ACTION ITEMS

### Pre-Build Checklist
- [ ] Total exposure calculated before placing bets
- [ ] No single game >25% of nightly exposure
- [ ] Foundation bets placed before pyramid bets
- [ ] Hedge positions identified for heavy exposure games
- [ ] Cross-game diversification achieved

### Portfolio Review Questions
1. If Game X goes badly, what % of bankroll is at risk?
2. Are my bets on independent or correlated outcomes?
3. Is my foundation solid enough to absorb pyramid losses?
4. Do I have hedges in place for worst-case scenarios?

---

## 6. STAKE SIZING REMINDERS

| Tier | NHL Stake | NFL Stake | Max % of Bankroll |
|------|-----------|-----------|-------------------|
| Foundation | $2.50 | $5-10 | 60-70% |
| Layers | $1.25 | $3-5 | 20-30% |
| Apex | $0.25-0.50 | $1-2 | 5-10% |

**Golden Rule:** Total nightly exposure should never exceed 10% of bankroll.

---

**Version:** 1.0  
**Owner:** Project Lead (Bam082608)  
**Purpose:** Ensure systematic diversification and prevent catastrophic single-game losses.
