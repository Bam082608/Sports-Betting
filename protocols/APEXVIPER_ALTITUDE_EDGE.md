# 🏔️ APEXVIPER ALTITUDE EDGE v1.0
**Owner:** Project Lead (Bam082608)  
**Directive:** Exploit altitude-based advantages in NHL matchups.

---

## 1. THE ALTITUDE ADVANTAGE LAW
**The Law:** High-altitude teams have a measurable edge, especially late in games.

**The Science:**
- Lower oxygen levels at altitude
- Visiting teams experience faster fatigue
- 3rd period is where altitude advantage peaks
- Teams acclimated to altitude have conditioning edge

---

## 2. HIGH-ALTITUDE TEAMS

### Tier 1: Extreme Altitude (5,000+ feet)
| Team | Arena | Elevation | Advantage Rating |
|------|-------|-----------|------------------|
| **Colorado Avalanche** | Ball Arena (Denver) | 5,280 ft | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Utah Hockey Club** | Delta Center (SLC) | 4,200 ft | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |

### Tier 2: Moderate Altitude (3,000-4,000 feet)
| Team | Arena | Elevation | Advantage Rating |
|------|-------|-----------|------------------|
| **Calgary Flames** | Scotiabank Saddledome | 3,557 ft | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Edmonton Oilers** | Rogers Place | 2,192 ft | ⭐⭐ |
| **Winnipeg Jets** | Canada Life Centre | 783 ft | ⭐ |

---

## 3. SEA-LEVEL TEAMS (Most Vulnerable)
**The Law:** Teams at or near sea level struggle most at altitude.

| Team | Home Elevation | Altitude Vulnerability |
|------|----------------|----------------------|
| **Florida Panthers** | 10 ft | HIGHLY VULNERABLE |
| **Tampa Bay Lightning** | 15 ft | HIGHLY VULNERABLE |
| **Carolina Hurricanes** | 315 ft | HIGHLY VULNERABLE |
| **New York Islanders** | 24 ft | HIGHLY VULNERABLE |
| **New Jersey Devils** | 33 ft | HIGHLY VULNERABLE |
| **Anaheim Ducks** | 157 ft | VULNERABLE |
| **Los Angeles Kings** | 340 ft | VULNERABLE |
| **San Jose Sharks** | 82 ft | VULNERABLE |
| **Seattle Kraken** | 20 ft | HIGHLY VULNERABLE |
| **Vancouver Canucks** | 10 ft | HIGHLY VULNERABLE |

---

## 4. THE 3RD PERIOD FATIGUE EFFECT
**The Law:** Altitude impact is most pronounced in the 3rd period.

**Why 3rd Period Matters:**
- Cumulative oxygen debt builds over 40+ minutes
- Leg fatigue compounds skating ability
- Mental sharpness declines with physical exhaustion
- Visiting teams often fade late

### Betting Applications
| Situation | Bet Target |
|-----------|------------|
| Sea-level team @ COL/UTA | 3P team total UNDER for visitor |
| Sea-level team @ COL/UTA | 3P live betting on home team |
| COL/UTA as road team | Less advantage (no altitude edge) |

---

## 5. ALTITUDE EDGE SCORING

### Home Game at Altitude
```
Altitude Edge Score = Elevation Difference × Fatigue Factor × Game Importance

Where:
- Elevation Difference: (Home elevation - Visitor elevation) / 1000
- Fatigue Factor: 1.0 (fresh), 1.5 (B2B), 2.0 (travel-heavy)
- Game Importance: 1.0 (regular), 1.2 (divisional), 1.5 (late season)

Score > 5: Strong altitude edge - EXPLOIT
Score 3-5: Moderate edge - CONSIDER
Score < 3: Minimal edge - Standard analysis
```

### Example Calculation
```
Florida @ Colorado:
- Elevation Difference: (5,280 - 10) / 1000 = 5.27
- Fatigue Factor: 1.0 (fresh)
- Game Importance: 1.0 (regular)
- Score: 5.27 × 1.0 × 1.0 = 5.27 → STRONG EDGE

Tampa @ Utah:
- Elevation Difference: (4,200 - 15) / 1000 = 4.19
- Fatigue Factor: 1.5 (B2B)
- Game Importance: 1.0 (regular)  
- Score: 4.19 × 1.5 × 1.0 = 6.28 → VERY STRONG EDGE
```

## 6. INTEGRATION WITH OTHER PROTOCOLS

### Combined with Fatigue Matrix
- Sea-level team + B2B + @ COL/UTA = **MAXIMUM FADE**
- Apply `APEXVIPER_FATIGUE_MATRIX.md` travel factors
- Compound the edge calculation

### Combined with Goalie Intelligence
- Backup goalie + altitude = amplified vulnerability
- Apply `APEXVIPER_GOALIE_INTELLIGENCE.md` stress factors

### Combined with Public Money
- Public often ignores altitude factor
- Sea-level favorites @ altitude = potential fade
- Apply `APEXVIPER_PUBLIC_MONEY.md` contrarian approach

## 7. BETTING STRATEGIES

### Home Games (COL/UTA)
| Opponent Type | Strategy |
|---------------|----------|
| Sea-level team | Lean home team, 3P props |
| Moderate elevation team | Standard analysis |
| Other high-altitude team | Altitude neutral |

### Road Games (COL/UTA)
| Situation | Strategy |
|-----------|----------|
| COL/UTA on road | No altitude advantage |
| COL/UTA conditioning | May still have edge late |
| Long road trip | Conditioning fades over time |

## 🎯 ACTION ITEMS

### Pre-Bet Checklist (Altitude)
- [ ] Identify if COL or UTA home game
- [ ] Check visitor's home elevation
- [ ] Calculate Altitude Edge Score
- [ ] Cross-reference with fatigue factors (B2B, travel)
- [ ] Consider 3P period-specific bets

### Future Tracking Reference
- Document altitude results in `research/altitude-tracking.md`
- Track sea-level team performance @ Denver/SLC
- Monitor 3rd period scoring differentials

---

## 8. QUICK REFERENCE

### Altitude Quick Decision Matrix
```
Sea-level team @ COL → STRONG EDGE for COL (5,280 ft)
Sea-level team @ UTA → STRONG EDGE for UTA (4,200 ft)
Sea-level + B2B @ COL/UTA → MAXIMUM FADE on visitor
COL/UTA on road → Altitude neutral (standard analysis)
```

### Most Vulnerable Matchups
1. FLA/TB/SEA/VAN @ Colorado
2. FLA/TB/SEA/VAN @ Utah
3. Any sea-level team @ altitude on B2B
4. Any sea-level team in 2nd game of altitude road trip
