## 🚨 CRITICAL FAILURES IDENTIFIED

### 1. GAME TOTALS FAILURE (4th Instance)
**Event:** Bet "Under 6.5" in Islanders game. Game ended 7 goals due to empty net chaos.
**Lesson:** Game totals rely on too many variables (4 units + empty net). Team totals rely on fewer (2 units + less empty net risk).
**Action:** **BANNED** Game Totals. **MANDATED** Team Totals.

### 2. THE CHALK PARLAY TRAP
**Event:** Parlayed Rockets/Celtics/Nuggets ML. Celtics (-316) lost.
**Lesson:** Heavy favorites fail often enough to kill parlays. The payout does not justify the risk.
**Action:** **AVOID** parlaying heavy favorites. Use Spreads or Spider Web.

### 3. PROMOTION PSYCHOLOGY
**Event:** Used 25% Boost token to bet $25 (10x unit) on NBA props. Lost.
**Lesson:** Boosts are bait to increase unit size.
**Action:** Boosts never change stake size. Max $5 on boosts.

## ✅ SUCCESSES

### 1. TEAM TOTALS STRUCTURE
**Event:** VGK/Flyers game used Team Totals (PHI Over 1.5, VGK Under 3.5).
**Result:** WON.
**Lesson:** This structure is superior to game totals.

### 2. MENTAL RESILIENCE
**Event:** Suffered 4 "bad beats" (one away) in one night.
**Reaction:** Laughter, no tilt, no chase.
**Result:** Bankroll preserved (~$600).
