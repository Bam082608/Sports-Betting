# 🛡️ PROTOCOL: TEAM TOTALS MANDATE

**STATUS:** ACTIVE (MANDATORY)
**EFFECTIVE DATE:** December 12, 2025
**TRIGGER:** 4th Instance of Game Total Failure (NYI 7-goal game vs Under 6.5)

## 1. THE CORE RULE
**"WE DO NOT BET FULL GAME TOTALS. WE BET TEAM TOTALS."**

This is a hard-coded constraint. No exceptions.

## 2. THE MATHEMATICAL LOGIC

### A. Variable Reduction
* **Game Total (Over/Under 6.5):** Relies on **4 Variables**.
    1. Team A Offense
    2. Team A Defense/Goaltending
    3. Team B Offense
    4. Team B Defense/Goaltending
* **Team Total (Over/Under 3.5):** Relies on **2 Variables**.
    1. Target Team Offense
    2. Opponent Defense/Goaltending

**Protocol:** We always choose the path of fewer variables.

### B. The Empty Net Chaos Factor
In a Game Total Under scenario (e.g., Under 6.5), the Empty Net is an uncontrolled risk.
* **Scenario:** Score is 4-2 (6 goals). 2 minutes left.
* **Game Total:** Goalie pulled. Team scores. 5-2 (7 goals). **BET LOST.**
* **Team Total (Losing Team Under 2.5):** They pull goalie. They concede. Their score remains 2. **BET WON.**

## 3. IMPLEMENTATION STRUCTURE

### The Defensive Structure (Low Scoring Expectation)
Instead of betting "Game Under 6.5":
* **Leg 1:** Favorite **OVER 1.5** or **2.5** (Floor play)
* **Leg 2:** Underdog **UNDER 2.5** or **3.5** (Ceiling play)

### The Offensive Structure (High Scoring Expectation)
Instead of betting "Game Over 6.5":
* **Leg 1:** Team A **OVER 2.5**
* **Leg 2:** Team B **OVER 2.5**
* *Note: If you cannot trust both teams to contribute, do not bet the Over.*

## 4. FANDUEL LIMITATIONS & WORKAROUNDS
FanDuel often removes the O/U 2.5 line for Team Totals.
* **Use 1.5** for safety/parlay ballast.
* **Use 3.5** for fading weak offenses (Under) or backing elite offenses (Over).
