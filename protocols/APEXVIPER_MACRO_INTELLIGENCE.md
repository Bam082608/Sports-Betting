**Directive:** Apply these "Universal Laws" to every slate analysis.

## 1. THE "ROAD DOG" PHENOMENON
**The Trend:** Road Underdogs are covering the Puck Line (+1.5) at a ~71% rate.  
**The Why:**
- **Market Error:** Linemakers overvalue "Home Ice" in a high-parity league.
- **The Equalizer:** The "middle class" of the NHL is tight; road teams play looser and simpler.
- **Action Rule:** When in doubt on a tight matchup, lean toward the **Road Dog +1.5** or Road Dog Moneyline.

## 2. THE "OLYMPIC SQUEEZE" (Fatigue Protocol)
**The Context:** The 2024–25 schedule is compressed for the 2026 Milano-Cortina games.  
**The Impact:**
- **"Schedule Losses":** Teams playing 3-in-4 nights or back-to-backs with travel are physically compromised.
- **The Fade:** If a Home Team returns from a long road trip without rest, **FADE THEM**. The usual "Last Change" advantage is negated by fatigue.

## 3. THE "VARIANCE VOID" (Goalie Injury Rule)
**The Concept:** A team's identity is tied to its Elite "System Goalie".  
**The Rule:** If a System Goalie (e.g., Hellebuyck, Swayman) is OUT, the team is functionally broken.
- Do **not** just adjust the line by a few cents.
- **FADE THE STRUCTURE.** The defense will collapse because they can't trust the backup.
- **Target:** Full-game Overs and Opponent Team Totals.

## 4. THE "WBS" (Worth Betting Score)
**Scoring System (1–10):**
- **10/10:** Auto-Fade or Auto-Bet (e.g., WPG without Hellebuyck).
- **8/10:** Strong System Match (e.g., MIN with Wallstedt starting).
- **7/10:** Situational Edge (e.g., DET as a home dog in a high-event spot).
- **<5/10:** Pass / Monitor only.

## 5. THE "HIGH-EVENT" VS "TRAP" CLASSIFICATION
- **High-Event Teams (e.g., DET, BUF, OTT):** Trade chances, rely on skill, weak structure.  
  - **Target:** Full-game and Team Total **OVERS**.
- **Trap Teams (e.g., MIN, selected others):** Clog the neutral zone, low event.  
  - **Target:** Game **UNDERS** and condensed shot environments.
