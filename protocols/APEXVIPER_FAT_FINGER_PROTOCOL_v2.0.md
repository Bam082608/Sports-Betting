# 🚨 APEXVIPER FAT FINGER PROTOCOL v2.0
**Version:** 2.0
**Effective Date:** 2025-12-03
**Status:** ACTIVE
**Trigger:** Any bet placed with incorrect stake (e.g., $95 instead of $0.95)

---

## 1. THE PROBLEM
**Cognitive Trap:** "I made a mistake, I must cancel it." -> "I cancelled it, now I'm safe." -> **"I forgot to re-place the correct bet."**

**Result:** You avoid the catastrophic loss from the error, but you **lose the researched edge** because the intended bet never gets placed.

---

## 2. THE PROTOCOL

**IF you realize you made a fat finger error (incorrect stake):**

### STEP 1: KILL THE EXPOSURE (Immediate)
*   **Action:** Cash out the bet immediately.
*   **Goal:** Eliminate the unintended risk.
*   **Acceptance:** Accept the "stupid tax" (e.g., losing $5-10 on cash out spread). This is the cost of doing business. **DO NOT** let the bet ride hoping to win.

### STEP 2: THE RE-BET DECISION (Immediate - <2 mins)
Ask yourself 3 questions:
1.  Was this bet researched? (Y/N)
2.  Was it part of my system? (Y/N)
3.  Did I intend to make this bet? (Y/N)

### STEP 3: EXECUTE RECOVERY
**IF ALL YES:**
*   **Action:** IMMEDIATELY re-place the bet at the **CORRECT** stake.
*   **Timing:** Do this within 120 seconds of the cash out.
*   **Logic:** The error was the *amount*, not the *bet*. The edge still exists. Don't punish your bankroll twice (loss on cashout + missed win on edge).

**IF ANY NO:**
*   **Action:** Walk away. Do not re-bet.

## 3. EXAMPLE SCENARIO
*   **Intended:** $0.95 on MTL +3.5
*   **Actual:** $95.00 on MTL +3.5
*   **Step 1:** Cash out for $78 (Loss: $17). **Exposure killed.**
*   **Step 2:** Was it researched? Yes. System? Yes. Intended? Yes.
*   **Step 3:** **IMMEDIATELY bet $0.95 on MTL +3.5.**
*   **Outcome:** Bet wins. You recover $1-2 of the $17 loss. You kept the process intact.

## 4. MANTRA
> "Kill the exposure, keep the edge. Process > Outcome."
