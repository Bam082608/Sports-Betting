## ✅ ALWAYS DO

**1. Use 2P+3P period splits for Tier 1 stars**
- NOT total game props
- Skip 1st period (feeling-out phase)
- 2nd+3rd = established patterns

**2. Use simple 2+ SOG for role players**
- NOT period splits (inconsistent)
- Group 3-4 players per ticket

**3. Hedge when betting 5+ props in same game**
- Game Under 6.5 or 5.5
- Both teams +2.5 alt puck line
- Stake: $3-5
- Prevents defensive grind losses

**4. Verify before betting**
- DailyFaceoff.com for goalies/lines
- Twitter for late scratches
- Check injuries 2 hours before puck drop

**5. Bet Tier 1 stars EVERY game they play**
- No exceptions
- Even vs elite defense
- Volume is independent of opponent

---

## ❌ NEVER DO

**1. Treat role players like stars**
- Different strategies
- Role players = 2+ SOG combos only
- Stars = 2P+3P splits only

**2. Bet D-men vs defensive teams**
- Carolina Hurricanes (elite shot-blocking)
- Boston Bruins (defensive system)
- New Jersey Devils (defensive system)
- Vegas Golden Knights (strong defense)

**3. Bet NFL passing in cold weather**
- Under 40°F = run-heavy
- Check weather.com before NFL bets
- Bet RB props in bad weather instead

**4. Skip verification of current data**
- Training data ends January 2025
- ALWAYS verify live before betting
- Don't trust AI memory for rosters/injuries

**5. Increase stakes after losses**
- No chasing
- No revenge betting
- Stick to system

---

## 🚫 TEAMS TO AVOID

### Carolina Hurricanes
- **DO NOT bet:** Opponent D-men vs CAR
- **Evidence:** CGY @ CAR (Nov 29) - Only 26 total shots, all props failed
- **What saved us:** Under hedge won +$5.00
- **Strategy:** Bet Under or skip entirely

### Calgary Flames
- **DO NOT bet:** Individual props
- **Why:** Distributed shots, no concentration
- **Evidence:** Nov 29 - 15 SOG spread across roster, no one dominated

### Minnesota Wild
- **DO NOT bet:** Individual props
- **Why:** Balanced attack, no 25%+ shooter

---

### IF TIER 1 STAR PLAYING → BET HEAVY ✅
- Build full 3-ticket structure

### IF OPPONENT IS CAR/BOS/NJ/VGK → ADD HEDGE ⚠️

- Protects against defensive grind

### IF 5+ PROPS IN SAME GAME → HEDGE MANDATORY 🚨
- Under or alt spreads
- Prevents total loss

## 🎯 SUCCESS FACTORS

**System Works Because:**
1. Tier 1 stars shoot regardless of team performance
2. 2P+3P splits avoid 1st period variance
3. Hedge protects against defensive grind games
4. Pyramid structure = foundation covers parlays
5. Discipline > everything else

**Trust the Process:**
- 18-6-1 record on SOG props (72% hit rate)
- Grew from $40 to $609 following system
- Previous peak: $6,600 (proves it works)
- Expected: $609 → $75,739 in 4 months (conservative)

---

2. If YES → Bet 2P+3P ($2.50)
3. If NO → Skip the game
4. If 5+ props → Add hedge
5. If unclear → DON'T BET

**Remember:**
- Better to miss a bet than lose money
- System works long-term

- Everyone else = Selective
