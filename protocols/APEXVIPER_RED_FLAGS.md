**Purpose:** A master list of bets that are strictly forbidden due to negative EV, structural flaws, or historical failure.

---

## 🚫 ABSOLUTE BANS

### 1. FULL GAME TOTALS (Over/Under 6.5, etc.)
**Status:** BANNED (Dec 12, 2025)
**Reason:** The "Empty Net" variable introduces uncontrollable variance. A winning Under 6.5 bet (4-2) becomes a loss (5-2) with an empty net goal.
**Alternative:** Team Totals (Over 2.5 / Under 2.5).

### 2. HEAVY FAVORITE PARLAYS
**Status:** BANNED (Dec 12, 2025)
**Reason:** Parlaying teams with odds worse than -200 (e.g., -300, -400) creates negative EV. One upset kills the entire ticket, and the payout does not justify the compounded risk.
**Alternative:** Spread betting (Dog +Points) or Single Bets.

### 3. CONTRADICTORY NARRATIVES
**Status:** BANNED
**Reason:** Betting Over AND Under in the same game, or outcomes that require conflicting game scripts.
**Example:** Betting "Goalie shutout" AND "Over 6.5 goals".

### 4. LIVE BETTING
**Status:** BANNED
**Reason:** Emotional decision making, poor odds, and lack of analysis time. All bets must be placed pre-game.

### 5. CHASING LOSSES
**Status:** BANNED
**Reason:** Increasing stake size to recover losses from earlier games. This is the fastest way to ruin.

## ⚠️ CAUTION ZONES

### 1. PROFIT BOOSTS
**Status:** WARNING
**Reason:** Designed to disrupt unit sizing. Never increase stake size to "maximize" a boost. Stick to standard unit.

### 2. PUBLIC CHALK
**Status:** WARNING
**Reason:** When >90% of money is on one side, be extremely cautious. Books often need that side to lose.
