# 🚩 RED FLAGS - DO NOT BET LIST
## Absolute "STOP" Conditions

**Status:** MANDATORY
**Last Updated:** December 12, 2025
**Authority:** Hard-learned lessons

---

## ❌ PERMANENTLY BANNED

### 1. GAME TOTALS (NEW - 12/12/25)

**NEVER BET:**
- Over/Under on combined game totals (O/U 6.5, 5.5, etc.)
- Any full game total in any configuration

**Rationale:**
- 4 documented failures
- Too many uncontrollable variables
- Empty net variance unpredictable

**Use Instead:**
- Team-specific totals only
- See: TEAM_TOTALS_MANDATE.md

---

### 2. THE TITANIC RULE (ANCHOR CONFLICTS)

**NEVER:**
- Use same team across multiple tickets as anchor
- Example: Dallas ML on Ticket A + Dallas ML on Ticket B

**Rationale:**
- Single team loss sinks multiple ships
- The "Florida Massacre" taught this lesson
- Learned: December 2024

**Anchor System v2.1:**
- Defensive Anchor: Team/player unders (defensive narrative)
- Offensive Anchor: Team/player overs (offensive narrative)
- Middle Anchor: Time-Hedged (experimental)
- NEVER mix anchor types in same slate

---

### 3. BETTING DURING GAMES

**NEVER:**
- Live bet during active gameplay
- Emotional in-game wagering
- Chase betting after bad beat

**Exception:**
- Pre-planned "Variance Double-Down" strategy
- Fundamental thesis unchanged
- Bet size: 50% of original wager maximum

**Rationale:**
- Emotional betting = tilt
- No edge on live lines
- Books have more information than you

---

### 4. CHALK PARLAYS (NEW - 12/12/25)

**NEVER:**
- 3+ team parlays where ALL legs are -200 or heavier
- Example: Rockets -313 / Celtics -316 / Nuggets -370

**Rationale:**
- Public pounds favorites
- Books need upsets to profit
- One upset (52% probability) kills entire parlay
- Individual 76% probabilities ≠ 76% combined

**Use Instead:**
- Mix favorites with underdogs/spreads
- Spider Web individual bets
- See: CHALK_PARLAY_ECONOMICS.md

---

### 5. OVERSIZED PROFIT BOOST STAKES (NEW - 12/12/25)

**NEVER:**
- Bet more than $5 with profit boost
- Overbet to "maximize boost value"
- Bet outside primary system for boost

**Rationale:**
- Boosts designed to make you overbet
- "Free money" is psychological trap
- Letting boosts expire = smart discipline

**Rule:**
- Maximum boost stake: $5 (forever)
- See: PROMOTION_PSYCHOLOGY.md

---

## ⚠️ HIGH-RISK SITUATIONS

### 6. BACKUP GOALIE STARTS

**Caution When:**
- Team starting backup goalie
- No rest advantage
- Against strong offensive opponent

**Automatic Fade If:**
- Backup has <.900 save percentage
- Against top-10 offense
- Road game
- Team on back-to-back

**Exception:**
- Elite backup (Skinner, Markstrom backup years)
- System defensive team (structure protects)

---

### 7. SECOND NIGHT OF BACK-TO-BACK

**Caution When:**
- Team played last night
- Travel involved
- Against rested opponent

**Automatic Fade If:**
- Lost last night (morale factor)
- Long travel (cross-country)
- Playing elite rested team

**Exception:**
- Team has elite depth
- Coach rests stars strategically

---

### 8. ALTITUDE (COLORADO)

**Never Bet:**
- Visiting teams in Denver (first game)
- High totals on visiting offenses

**Rationale:**
- Altitude affects visiting teams significantly
- Takes 2-3 games to adjust
- Avs have 36% home-ice edge (highest in NHL)

**Exception:**
- Avalanche opponents on spreads (+2.5, +3.5)
- Home team totals (altitude helps them)

---

### 9. LINE MOVEMENT RED FLAGS

**Do Not Bet If:**
- Line moves 1+ goal against your read
- Sharp money clearly on other side
- Unexplained goalie change
