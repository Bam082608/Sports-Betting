# ⚓ APEXVIPER ANCHOR VARIANTS PROTOCOL v2.1
**Version:** 2.1
**Effective Date:** 2025-12-03
**Status:** ACTIVE
**Purpose:** Prevent logical conflicts in Anchor construction.

---

## 1. THE CORE PRINCIPLE
**"Match structure to narrative. Don't bet against yourself."**

**The Error:** Betting an OVER in your Anchor while betting an UNDER as insurance/hedge.
*   *Result:* You hedge yourself out of profit. If the game goes Under, your insurance wins but your Anchor dies. If Over, Anchor wins but insurance dies.

## 3. DECISION CHECKLIST
Before placing an Anchor, check your Insurance bets for that game:

1.  **Am I betting Under Insurance?**
    *   YES -> Must use **VARIANT A (Defensive)**.
2.  **Am I betting Over Insurance?**
    *   YES -> Must use **VARIANT B (Offensive)**.
3.  **Am I betting NO Insurance?**
    *   Match Anchor to your narrative (Offensive or Defensive).

> **Rule:** Never have an Anchor leg that directly contradicts your Insurance bet.
