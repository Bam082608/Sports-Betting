# 🛑 TILT PREVENTION & MENTAL GAME

**Purpose:** Protocols for maintaining emotional control and protecting the bankroll during variance storms.

## 1. THE "TOO ABSURD" PRINCIPLE

**Concept:** When variance becomes statistically improbable (e.g., 4 "one-away" losses in a row), the correct response is **Laughter**, not Rage.

**Mechanism:**
- **Rage:** "This is unfair! I need to win it back!" -> Leads to bad bets.
- **Laughter:** "This is a simulation. It's funny how perfect the loss was." -> Leads to detachment.

**Protocol:**
- If you lose 3+ bets by a margin of 0.5 or 1 point/goal: **STOP.**
- Acknowledge the absurdity.
- Close the app.
- Do not bet again until the next day.

## 2. THE "LET IT EXPIRE" RULE (PROMOS)

**Concept:** Unused profit boosts or bonus bets are not "losses". They are "avoided traps".

**Protocol:**
- If a promotion requires a bet that doesn't fit your system: **LET IT EXPIRE.**
- The cost of a forced bad bet (-$25) is greater than the value of an expired boost ($0).

## 3. VARIANCE RESILIENCE

**Truth:** You can do everything right and still lose.
- **Process > Outcome.**
- If the analysis was sound, the loss is just "tuition" or "variance".
- Do not change the system based on one bad night (unless a structural flaw like "Game Totals" is identified).

## 4. RECOVERY PROTOCOL

**After a Bad Night:**
1. **No Chasing:** Do not increase stakes the next day to "make it back".
2. **Grind Mode:** Return to standard unit sizing.
3. **Review:** Analyze the losses. Was it bad luck (variance) or bad strategy?
   - *Bad Luck:* Continue as is.
   - *Bad Strategy:* Adjust protocol (e.g., Banning Game Totals).
