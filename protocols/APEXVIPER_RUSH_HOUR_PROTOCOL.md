## 1. THE GOLDEN RULES

### RULE 1: NO DRIVING AND BETTING
*   **Absolute Ban:** Never place bets while operating a vehicle.
*   **Why:** Cognitive split attention leads to 100x errors (e.g., betting $95 instead of $0.95).
*   **Cost:** Safety + Bankroll (Proven loss of $17+ per incident).

### RULE 2: THE 15-MINUTE BUFFER
*   If you have <15 minutes before you must leave/start work/engage in a mandatory task: **STOP.**
*   You do not have time to execute the full verification process.
*   **Miss the bet.** The market will be there tomorrow.

## 2. THE TWO-PHASE SYSTEM

### PHASE 1: "SET AND FORGET" (Calm State)
*   **When:** 30-60 minutes BEFORE the rush (e.g., at home before leaving for work).
*   **What:** Simple, single-leg props or prepared Anchors.
*   **Action:** Place the core bets calmly.
*   **Goal:** Ensure you have "action" so you don't feel FOMO later.

### PHASE 2: "COMPLEX EXECUTION" (Optional)
*   **When:** Only if you have a calm window (lunch break, parked car, desk time).
*   **What:** Complex parlays, God Tickets, Combos.
*   **Condition:** If no calm window exists, **SKIP PHASE 2.**
*   **Logic:** Complex tickets require focus. If you can't focus, don't build them.

## 3. RECOVERY PROTOCOL
**If you miss a bet due to Rush Hour rules:**
1.  **Acknowledge:** "I missed an opportunity, but I saved my process."
2.  **Release:** Do not chase. Do not force a bad bet on a later game to "make up" for it.
3.  **Log:** Record it as a "Discipline Win" in the daily log.

## 4. MANTRA
> "Slow is smooth. Smooth is fast. Rushing is expensive."
