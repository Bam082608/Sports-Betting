## 1. DEFINITION
**Black Swan Insurance:** A small, high-odds bet placed on the **complete opposite** outcome of your main thesis.
*   *Not a Hedge:* A hedge locks in profit. Insurance limits catastrophic loss.

---

## 2. WHEN TO DEPLOY
**Trigger Conditions (Any 2+):**
1.  **Concentration:** Betting one direction (e.g., Offense) >70% of game portfolio.
2.  **Volume:** 3+ tickets dependent on the same outcome (e.g., 3 Over tickets).
3.  **Exposure:** Heavy ML/Spread usage on one team.
4.  **Doubt:** "What if I'm completely wrong?"

## 3. CONSTRUCTION RULES

### SIZING
*   **Cost:** 10-15% of total game portfolio.
*   *Example:* $8.00 portfolio -> $0.80 - $1.20 Insurance.

### ODDS
*   **Minimum:** +300 (3.00 decimal)
*   **Ideal:** +400 to +500
*   *Why:* Small stake needs massive multiplier to cover the main portfolio losses.

### STRUCTURE
*   **Main Thesis:** "Game will be a shootout (Over)."
*   **Insurance:** **Alt Total Under 3.5 (+450)**
*   *Logic:* If game is 2-1, your Over bets die, but Insurance pays 4.5x, covering the loss.
