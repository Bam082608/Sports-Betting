## 2. EXPOSURE LIMITS (TITANIC RULE ENFORCEMENT)

### The Titanic Rule
**"Never put so many eggs in one basket that a single sinking destroys everything."**

### Team Exposure Limits

| Metric | Max Limit | Reason |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **Tickets featuring same team** | 2 max | Diversification across slate |
| **Same team in parlays** | 50% of parlay legs max | Avoid correlated collapse |
| **Single game exposure** | 25% of nightly stake | No single-game dependency |
| **Same outcome dependency** | Never | (e.g., Team ML + Team spread) |

### Player Exposure Limits

| Metric | Max Limit | Reason |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **Same player across all tickets** | 2 appearances max | Avoid single-player dependency |
| **Players from same team in parlay** | 2 max per parlay | Reduce correlation risk |
| **Same prop type (e.g., SOG)** | 70% of total props max | Mix prop types |

### Titanic Rule Compliance Checklist

Before placing bets, verify:
- [ ] No team appears in more than 2 tickets
- [ ] No player appears in more than 2 tickets
- [ ] No single game represents >25% of nightly stake
- [ ] No parlay has >50% legs from same team
- [ ] Exposure spread across 3+ games minimum

---

## 3. DIVERSIFICATION MANDATES

### Minimum Requirements

| Requirement | Rule | Enforcement |
|-------------|------|-------------|
| **Team Representation** | Min 3 different teams per night | Block bets if not met |
| **Game Spread** | Bets across min 2 games | Block single-game nights |
| **Prop Type Mixing** | At least 2 different prop types | SOG + Points, or SOG + Assists, etc. |

### Recommended Prop Type Mix

| Prop Type | Recommended % | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|-------|
| **Shots on Goal (SOG)** | 40-60% | Core system focus |
| **Points** | 20-30% | Tier 1 stars only |
| **Goals** | 10-20% | Selective, high-odds |
| **Assists** | 10-20% | Correlation plays |
| **Saves** | 5-10% | Goalie-specific |

---

## 4. PORTFOLIO EXAMPLES

### ✅ COMPLIANT PORTFOLIO (Good Example)

**Scenario:** 4 NHL games tonight, $650 bankroll

```
FOUNDATION BETS ($12.00 total - 60% allocation)
├── Bet 1: Robertson (DAL) 3+ SOG @ -140 .......... $6.00
└── Bet 2: Bedard (CHI) 2+ SOG @ -165 ............. $6.00

LAYER PARLAYS ($5.00 total - 25% allocation)
├── Parlay 1 (2 legs): ............................ $2.50
│   ├── Hintz (DAL) 2+ SOG @ -180
│   └── Gauthier (ANA) 2+ SOG @ -170
│   └── Combined Odds: +160
│
└── Parlay 2 (3 legs): ............................ $2.50
    ├── Heiskanen (DAL) 2+ SOG @ -130
    ├── Makar (COL) 2+ SOG @ -160
    └── Power (BUF) 2+ SOG @ -140
    └── Combined Odds: +350

LOTTERY TICKET ($1.50 total - 7.5% allocation)
└── Parlay (4 legs): .............................. $1.50
    ├── Robertson (DAL) Point @ +110
    ├── Bedard (CHI) Point @ +120
    ├── Makar (COL) Point @ -130
    └── Hintz (DAL) Goal @ +180
    └── Combined Odds: +1500

HEDGE (If needed): ................................ $0.00
└── [To be determined based on Foundation bet exposure]

TOTAL EXPOSURE: $18.50 (2.8% of bankroll) ✅
```

**Compliance Check:**
- ✅ DAL appears in 2 tickets (within limit)
- ✅ Robertson appears in 2 tickets (within limit)
- ✅ 4 different teams represented
- ✅ Spread across 4 games
- ✅ Multiple prop types (SOG, Points, Goals)
- ✅ No single game >25% of stake
- ✅ Total risk within 2.5-3% range

---

### ❌ NON-COMPLIANT PORTFOLIO (Bad Example)

**Scenario:** Same 4 NHL games, $650 bankroll

```
❌ BAD PORTFOLIO - DO NOT DO THIS

Bet 1: DAL ML @ -150 .............................. $10.00
Bet 2: DAL -1.5 @ +120 ............................ $5.00
Bet 3: Robertson (DAL) 3+ SOG @ -140 .............. $5.00
Bet 4: Hintz (DAL) 2+ Points @ +100 ............... $5.00
Bet 5: DAL Team Total Over 3.5 @ -110 ............. $5.00

TOTAL EXPOSURE: $30.00 (4.6% of bankroll) ❌
```

**Violations:**
- ❌ DAL appears in ALL 5 bets (max is 2)
- ❌ 100% exposure on single team
- ❌ Highly correlated outcomes (if DAL loses, everything loses)
- ❌ Total risk exceeds 3% maximum
- ❌ No diversification across games
- ❌ "Titanic Problem" - one bad game sinks everything

---

### 🟡 BORDERLINE PORTFOLIO (Acceptable but Risky)

**Scenario:** Same 4 NHL games, $650 bankroll

```
⚠️ BORDERLINE - Proceed with Caution

Bet 1: Robertson (DAL) 3+ SOG @ -140 .............. $7.00
Bet 2: Hintz (DAL) 2+ SOG @ -180 .................. $5.00
Parlay: 3 DAL players SOG props ................... $3.00
Bet 3: Bedard (CHI) 2+ SOG @ -165 ................. $3.00

TOTAL EXPOSURE: $18.00 (2.8% of bankroll) ⚠️
```

**Issues (Rule Violations):**
- ❌ DAL in 3 tickets (VIOLATES 2 max rule - must fix before betting)
- ⚠️ Heavy team concentration (DAL)
- ❌ Only 2 teams represented (VIOLATES 3 minimum rule)
- ✅ Total risk within acceptable range

**Recommendation:** This portfolio is NON-COMPLIANT. You MUST swap one DAL bet for a different team to meet portfolio rules before placing bets.

## 5. DECISION CRITERIA (YES/NO RULESET)

### Pre-Bet Decision Tree

```
STEP 1: Total Nightly Risk Check
├── Is total planned stake ≤3% of bankroll?
│   ├── YES → Continue
│   └── NO → REDUCE stakes until ≤3%

STEP 2: Team Concentration Check
├── Does any team appear in >2 tickets?
│   ├── YES → REMOVE or REPLACE excess exposure
│   └── NO → Continue

STEP 3: Player Concentration Check
├── Does any player appear in >2 tickets?
│   ├── YES → REMOVE or REPLACE excess exposure
│   └── NO → Continue

STEP 4: Single Game Exposure Check
├── Does any single game represent >25% of nightly stake?
│   ├── YES → REDUCE stake on that game
│   └── NO → Continue

STEP 5: Diversification Check
├── Are at least 3 different teams represented?
│   ├── YES → Continue
│   └── NO → ADD bets on different teams or SKIP night

STEP 6: Prop Type Mix Check
├── Are at least 2 different prop types included?
│   ├── YES → ✅ PORTFOLIO APPROVED
│   └── NO → ADD variety or ACCEPT reduced diversification
```

## 6. SLATE SIZE ADJUSTMENTS

### Small Slate (2-4 games)

| Rule | Adjustment |
|------|------------|
| Max teams per ticket | 2 (down from 3) |
| Total exposure | Reduce to 2% max |
| Lottery tickets | Skip (limited options) |
| Diversification | Accept 2 teams minimum |

### Medium Slate (5-8 games)

| Rule | Adjustment |
|------|------------|
| Standard rules apply | No changes |
| Target | 3-4 different teams |
| Full portfolio | Foundation + Layers + Lottery |

### Large Slate (9+ games)

| Rule | Adjustment |
|------|------------|
| Max games to analyze | 5 (avoid paralysis) |
| Diversification | Target 4+ teams |
| Lottery opportunities | Can increase slightly |
| Hedge opportunities | More options available |

---

## 7. CORRELATION AWARENESS

### High Correlation (AVOID combining)

| Combination | Risk |
|-------------|------|
| Team ML + Team spread | Same outcome dependency |
| Team total over + Player points | Correlated success |
| 3+ players same team in parlay | Single-game collapse risk |
| Game over + Both team totals over | Redundant exposure |

### Low Correlation (SAFE to combine)

| Combination | Benefit |
|-------------|---------|
| Player SOG from different teams | Independent outcomes |
| Player props across different games | Diversified risk |
| Team ML + Different team props | Uncorrelated success |

### Negative Correlation (HEDGE value)

| Combination | Use Case |
|-------------|----------|
| Player SOG over + Game under | Hedges scoring expectation |
| Team ML + Opponent props | Partial hedge if team loses |

---
