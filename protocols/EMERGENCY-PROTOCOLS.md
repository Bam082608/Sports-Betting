# 🚨 EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS

**Status:** ✅ PRODUCTION-READY  
**Last Drill:** [TBD - schedule first drill]  
**Next Drill:** Monthly on 1st of each month

## ⚡ OVERVIEW

This protocol defines the 3-level emergency response system for crisis situations. These are not "regular" losing nights - these are systematic threats to bankroll and mental health that require immediate intervention.

**Critical Principle:** Recognizing an emergency early is more important than solving it perfectly.

### Recovery Protocol (After Minimum 7 Days)

**Before Even Considering Resumption:**

1. **Professional Evaluation**
   - Consulted with therapist or counselor
   - Honest assessment: Is this addiction?
   - Developed relapse prevention plan
   - Identified triggers and coping strategies

2. **Financial Stability Restored**
   - All bills paid
   - Emergency fund intact
   - No debt incurred from betting
   - Bankroll = discretionary funds ONLY

3. **Support System Established**
   - Accountability partner identified
   - Daily check-in system created
   - Emergency contact list ready
   - Someone who can intervene if needed

4. **New Safeguards Implemented**
   - Deposit limits on all sportsbooks ($50/day max)
   - Betting time limits (no betting after 10 PM)
   - Mandatory 24-hour breaks between sessions
   - Weekly session with therapist or support group

### Decision: Resume or Quit?

**Ask yourself honestly:**

```
If answer is YES to ANY of these, DO NOT RESUME:

□ Do I need betting to feel excited/happy?
□ Have I lied to others about my betting?
□ Has betting damaged important relationships?
□ Do I bet more than I can afford to lose?
□ Do I feel unable to control my betting?
□ Has betting interfered with work/school?
□ Do I bet to escape problems or feelings?

If you checked ANY box: Betting may not be for you.
Consider permanent self-exclusion.
This is not failure - this is self-awareness.
```

### If Resuming (With Extreme Caution)

**New Operating Rules:**
- Maximum bankroll: $200 (never exceed)
- Maximum daily risk: $5 (never exceed)
- Maximum session length: 30 minutes
- Mandatory 48-hour break between sessions
- Weekly therapy/support group attendance
- Monthly review with accountability partner

**One More Level 3 = Permanent Quit**

```

### Weekly Audit

- Bankroll trend: Up, down, or stable?
- Am I enjoying this or is it stressing me out?

**Red Flags:**
- Hiding betting activity
- Thinking about betting constantly
- Betting interfering with other life areas
- Need to bet bigger to feel excitement

---

## 🔄 DRILL SCHEDULE

### Monthly Emergency Drill (1st of each month)

**Purpose:** Ensure you can execute protocols under stress

**Drill Procedure:**
1. Set timer for 5 minutes
2. Simulate Level 2 response (close sportsbooks, document, etc.)
3. Review emergency contacts
4. Check self-exclusion process (don't activate, just know how)
5. Update emergency log location

**Why Drills Matter:**
- Muscle memory for crisis response
- Removes friction when seconds count
- Identifies gaps in protocols
- Reduces panic through preparation

## 💡 PHILOSOPHICAL NOTE

### This Protocol Is Not Weakness

Having emergency protocols is **strength**, not weakness.

- Pilots have emergency checklists
- Hospitals have code blue procedures
- Fire departments drill for disasters

**You're not planning to fail. You're preparing to survive.**

### The Goal Is Never Needing This

Best case scenario: This file never gets used.

But if it does get used, **you'll be glad it exists**.
