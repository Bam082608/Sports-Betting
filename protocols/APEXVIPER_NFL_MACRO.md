# 🏈 APEXVIPER NFL MACRO INTELLIGENCE v1.0
**Owner:** Project Lead (Bam082608)  
**Directive:** Apply these 5 "Universal Laws" to every NFL slate analysis.

---

## 1. THE WEATHER LAW
**The Trend:** Cold weather games favor the run game and suppress passing.  
**The Thresholds:**
- **Temperature:** <40°F = run-heavy environment
- **Wind:** >15mph = avoid passing props, target rushing
- **Rain/Snow:** Heavy precipitation = low-scoring affairs

**Evidence:** Bills/Steelers cold weather games consistently produce under totals and RB dominance.

**Action Rule:** In cold weather matchups (<40°F or >15mph wind):
- ✅ **BET:** RB rushing props, game unders
- ❌ **FADE:** QB passing props, WR receiving yards

---

## 2. THE INDOOR/OUTDOOR LAW
**The Concept:** Dome teams struggle in outdoor cold/wind environments.

**Indoor Dome Teams (Vulnerable Outdoors):**
- Atlanta Falcons (Mercedes-Benz Stadium)
- Dallas Cowboys (AT&T Stadium)
- Detroit Lions (Ford Field)
- Indianapolis Colts (Lucas Oil Stadium)
- Las Vegas Raiders (Allegiant Stadium)
- Los Angeles Rams (SoFi Stadium)
- Los Angeles Chargers (SoFi Stadium)
- Minnesota Vikings (U.S. Bank Stadium)
- New Orleans Saints (Caesars Superdome)
- Arizona Cardinals (State Farm Stadium)
- Houston Texans (NRG Stadium)

**The Rule:** When dome teams travel to outdoor cold-weather venues:
- **FADE** their passing attack efficiency
- **TARGET** opponent ground game props
- **LEAN** unders in extreme conditions

---

## 3. THE PRIME TIME LAW
**The Trend:** National spotlight games produce different patterns.  
**The Why:**
- Extra preparation time (10+ days for some matchups)
- Coaching adjustments more pronounced
- Public money inflates favorites

**Prime Time Situations:**
- Thursday Night Football
- Sunday Night Football
- Monday Night Football
- International Games

**Action Rule:**
- **FADE:** Heavy public favorites (>70% betting)
- **LEAN:** Divisional underdogs in prime time
- **TARGET:** Experienced QBs over young QBs (nerves factor)

---

## 4. THE DIVISIONAL LAW
**The Trend:** Divisional games are tighter, more competitive.  
**The Why:**
- Teams know each other intimately
- Coaching familiarity reduces blowouts
- Revenge narratives more potent

**Action Rule:**
- **LEAN:** Divisional underdogs to cover
- **FADE:** Large spreads (-7.5 or more) in division games
- **TARGET:** Second meeting of the season (revenge factor amplified)

---

## 5. THE REVENGE LAW
**The Trend:** Teams with embarrassing losses often rebound strongly.  
**The Triggers:**
- Blowout loss (20+ points) in recent matchup
- Season sweep scenarios
- Playoff elimination memories

**Evidence:** Bills revenge games following playoff losses show elevated performance metrics.

**Action Rule:**
- **IDENTIFY:** Teams with clear revenge narrative
- **TARGET:** Revenge team in competitive spots
- **AVOID:** Fading revenge teams as large underdogs
