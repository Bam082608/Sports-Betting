# 📉 PARLAY STRATEGY & ECONOMICS

**Purpose:** Guidelines for constructing parlay tickets and avoiding common traps.

## 1. THE CHALK PARLAY TRAP

**Definition:** Combining multiple heavy favorites (Moneyline > -250) into a single ticket.

**Why It Fails:**
- **Implied Probability Mismatch:** A -300 favorite has ~75% win probability.
- **Compounding Risk:** 3 favorites = 0.75 * 0.75 * 0.75 = ~42% chance of winning all three.
- **Payout:** The payout is often only +100 to +120, which implies a ~50% chance. You are paying a premium for "safety" that doesn't exist.
- **The "One Bad Leg" Rule:** In a parlay of 3 heavy favorites, the probability of at least one losing is significantly higher than intuition suggests (~58%).

**Protocol:**
- **NEVER** parlay Moneylines worse than -200.
- **ALWAYS** look for the upset or spread cover instead.

## 2. CORRELATED PARLAYS (THE "GOOD" PARLAY)

**Definition:** Legs that are statistically linked. If Leg A hits, Leg B is MORE likely to hit.

**Examples:**
- **Narrative:** "High Scoring Game" -> Over 6.5 + Team A Over 3.5 + Team B Over 2.5.
- **Narrative:** "Defensive Grind" -> Under 6.5 + Under 1.5 1st Period.

**Protocol:**
- Build parlays around a **Single Game Narrative**.
- Ensure all legs support the same story.

## 3. SPIDER WEB STRATEGY

**Definition:** Instead of one giant parlay, break the legs into smaller, overlapping tickets or single bets.

**Benefit:**
- If one leg fails, you don't lose everything.
- Reduces variance.
