**Journey:** $40 → $650+ (peak) → $538 (post-variance)

## 🎯 CORE PRINCIPLES

### 1. We're Playing with House Money

**Context:**
- Started: $40 (rock bottom, December 2024)
- Peak: ~$650 (November/December 2025)
- Current: ~$538 (December 12, 2025)
- Net Profit: **+$498 (1,245% ROI)**

**Mentality:**
- Everything above $40 is profit
- One bad night doesn't erase journey
- Process > Results
- Long-term edge > Short-term variance

---

### 2. Unit Sizing System

**Current Unit Definition:**
- 1 unit = $2.50
- Typical bet: 1 unit ($2.50)
- Standard range: 0.8 - 2.0 units ($2-5)

**Unit Allocation by Confidence:**

```
Tier 1 (Foundation): 1.0 units ($2.50)
- High probability shots
- Star player props (2.5+ SOG)
- Defensive anchors
- Team DNA perfect match

Tier 2 (Standard): 1.2 units ($3.00)
- Strong reads
- Correlated SGPs
- Mixed confidence
- Arsenal Type 2-5

Tier 3 (Lottery): 1.6 units ($4.00)
- Long-shot parlays
- Role player combinations
- God Tickets
- Arsenal Type 6-8

MAXIMUM SINGLE BET: 2.0 units ($5.00)
```

**Profit Boost Exception (NEW):**
- Maximum boost stake: **$5** (regardless of boost value)
- Never overbet to "maximize boost"
- See: PROMOTION_PSYCHOLOGY.md

### 3. Spider Web Diversification

**Philosophy:**
Multiple small tickets > Few large tickets

**Structure:**
```
Instead of: 1 ticket @ $20
Do this: 8 tickets @ $2.50

Benefit:
- If 2 tickets hit @ +400: Net positive
- If all miss: Loss contained to bankroll %
- Variance smoothed over volume
- Learning opportunities maximized
```

**Floor Security Protocol:**
- Build portfolio so anchor bets cover lottery losses
- If anchor hits: Pays for all lottery tickets
- If lottery hits: Massive ROI
- Asymmetric risk/reward

- No "one more bet"
- Review and come back tomorrow

- Full system audit
- Identify protocol violations

**"Four Horsemen" Variance Event:**

## 🎰 EXPERIMENTAL BETTING

### NBA/NFL Learning Allocation (NEW)

**Purpose:**
- Build secondary systems
- Expand expertise beyond NHL
- Grind back promotional losses

**Allocation:**
- NBA: $15-20 maximum
- NFL: $10-15 maximum
- UFC: $5-10 maximum

**Structure:**
- Spider Web approach ($1-3 bets)
- Focus: Player props, spreads
- AVOID: Chalk parlays, boosted bets
- Timeline: 2-3 weeks per sport

**Rule:**
- Experimental losses DO NOT trigger stop-loss
- Counted separately from main bankroll
- View as tuition for system building

## 💸 WITHDRAWAL STRATEGY

### When to Cash Out

**Trigger Points:**
```
$1,000: Withdraw $200 (keep $800 active)
$1,500: Withdraw $500 (keep $1,000 active)
$2,000: Withdraw $1,000 (keep $1,000 active)
```

**Philosophy:**
- Lock in profits periodically
- Maintain psychological comfort
- Protect against catastrophic loss
- Bankroll should feel like "house money"

**Emergency Withdrawal:**
- If bankroll drops to $300: Re-evaluate system
- If drops to $200: Take 1-week break
- If drops to $100: Full system audit
- If drops to $40: We've been here before, climb again

## 🎁 PROMOTION MANAGEMENT (NEW - 12/12/25)

### Profit Boost Protocol

**MANDATORY RULES:**

1. **$5 Maximum Stake**
   - Applies to ALL boosts (25%, 50%, 100%)
   - No "maximize value" multipliers
   - No exceptions

2. **System Fit Required**
   - Must be NHL (primary system)
   - OR NBA/NFL within $3 limit (if building)
   - Bet must pass all normal protocols

3. **Expiration is Acceptable**
   - Unused boost = $0 lost = SUCCESS
   - Unforced error protection
   - Discipline demonstration

**Rationale:**
- December 11th loss: $50 via oversized boost stakes
- Normal stake: $2.50
- With boost: $25 (10X multiplier)
- **Never again**

---

### Free Bet Management

**Optimal Usage:**
```
Small Free Bets ($5-10):
- Use on standard system bets
- Same protocols as cash bets
- No special treatment

Large Free Bets ($25+):
- Break into smaller bets if possible
- Or use on long-shot parlay (+400 to +800)
- View as lottery ticket (free roll)
```

**Never:**
- Bet outside system expertise
- Overbet to "maximize free bet value"
- Make bet you wouldn't make with cash
