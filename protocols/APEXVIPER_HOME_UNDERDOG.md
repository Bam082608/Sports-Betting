# 🏠 APEXVIPER HOME UNDERDOG STRATEGY v1.0
**Owner:** Project Lead (Bam082608)  
**Directive:** Exploit the market inefficiency of NHL home underdogs.

---

## 1. THE HOME UNDERDOG LAW
**The Law:** NHL home underdogs cover the puck line at a significantly profitable rate.

**The Stat:** 63.9% cover rate on Home +1.5 puck line

**Why It Works:**
- Market overvalues road favorites
- Home ice advantage underpriced
- Last change (line matching) creates matchup control
- Crowd energy provides measurable boost
- Parity in NHL makes 2-goal margins rare

---

## 2. THE CORE STRATEGY

### Primary Play: Home +1.5 Puck Line
| Element | Specification |
|---------|---------------|
| **Bet Type** | Puck Line (spread) |
| **Selection** | Home team +1.5 goals |
| **Market** | Regulation (no OT) |
| **Edge** | 63.9% historical cover rate |

### Why +1.5 Over Moneyline
- Moneyline requires win
- +1.5 covers with win OR 1-goal loss
- Higher hit rate = more consistent returns
- Lower variance than ML underdogs

---

## 3. UPGRADE CONDITIONS
**The Law:** Certain situations amplify the home underdog edge.

### When to Increase Confidence
| Condition | Impact | Upgrade Action |
|-----------|--------|----------------|
| **Opponent on B2B** | Road fatigue + travel | +1 confidence tier |
| **Opponent on road trip (3+ games)** | Cumulative travel fatigue | +1 confidence tier |
| **Opponent missing key player** | Reduced firepower | +1 confidence tier |
| **Home team off 2+ days rest** | Fresh legs advantage | +1 confidence tier |
| **Home team revenge narrative** | Extra motivation | +1 confidence tier |

### Confidence Tier System
```
Base Tier: Home +1.5 (Standard play)
Tier +1: Stronger sizing consideration
Tier +2: Elevated confidence, larger stake
Tier +3: High conviction play
```

---

## 4. TARGET TEAMS (Frequent Home Underdogs)
**The Law:** Some teams are perpetually undervalued at home.

| Team | Why They're Undervalued | Home Dog Profile |
|------|------------------------|------------------|
| **ANA (Anaheim)** | Rebuilding perception | Often +1.5 at home |
| **STL (St. Louis)** | Inconsistent season | Underdog frequently |
| **UTA (Utah)** | New market, unknown | Market uncertainty |
| **PHI (Philadelphia)** | Young roster narrative | Underestimated at home |
| **SJS (San Jose)** | Rebuilding tank mode | Large underdogs often |
| **BUF (Buffalo)** | Perennial disappointment | Undervalued at home |
| **CHI (Chicago)** | Rebuilding phase | Often big underdogs |

### Notes on Target Teams
- These teams frequently appear as +1.5 or larger
- Home ice gives them legitimate chance to stay close
- 1-goal losses still cover the spread
- Value exists because market expects blowouts

---

## 5. SITUATIONS TO AVOID

### When Home Underdog Edge Weakens
| Situation | Why | Action |
|-----------|-----|--------|
| **Home team on B2B** | Negates rest advantage | AVOID or downgrade |
| **Home team missing starter** | Goalie edge lost | Check backup quality |
| **Road team on extended rest** | Fresh legs equalizer | Standard analysis only |
| **Heavy public on home dog** | Value already priced in | Check line movement |

### Red Flags
- Home underdog line moving AGAINST them
- Sharp money reported on road favorite
- Goalie mismatch (backup vs elite starter)
- Injured star player for home team

---

## 6. BANKROLL APPLICATION

### Stake Sizing for Home Dogs
| Confidence Level | Stake | Notes |
|-----------------|-------|-------|
| **Base** | Standard unit | Basic home +1.5 play |
| **Tier +1** | 1.25x unit | One upgrade condition |
| **Tier +2** | 1.5x unit | Two upgrade conditions |
| **Tier +3** | 2x unit | Multiple strong upgrades |

### Portfolio Integration
- Home dogs fit "Foundation" tier (consistent edge)
- Can combine with props for correlation plays
- Hedge consideration when also betting player props
