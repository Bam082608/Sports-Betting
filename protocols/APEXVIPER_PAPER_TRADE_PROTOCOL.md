# APEXVIPER PAPER TRADE PROTOCOL
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Date:** 2025-12-04
**Status:** ACTIVE

## 1. PHILOSOPHY & MINDSET

### The "Elite Risk Thinking" Principle
> "The guy hit his last shot in overtime. Game doesn't go to OT? I'm out $100. There's any way you can look at it. You choose which way you want to look at it."

This protocol is built on **Process-Oriented Thinking**, not Results-Oriented Thinking.
*   **Not Results-Oriented:** We do not judge a bet solely by whether it won or lost.
*   **Not Emotional:** We eliminate "I'm so mad" or "I knew it" reactions.
*   **Probabilistic:** We acknowledge that any single game is a set of probabilities, not certainties.
*   **Systematic:** We track decisions to find patterns in our *edge identification*, independent of execution errors (like fat fingers or timing).

## 2. THE PAPER TRADE PROCESS

**Goal:** To build a dataset of "What we thought" vs "What happened" to validate edge identification without the pressure of live fire on every single game, or to validate new strategies (like the Boost System) before full deployment.

### The Workflow
1.  **Document Thesis:** Before puck drop, record the edge, the narrative, and the specific tickets we *would* have played.
2.  **Track Reality:** After the game, record the actual box score and results.
3.  **Pattern Recognition:** Compare Thesis vs. Reality to identify:
    *   **Validated Patterns:** Strategies that work consistently (e.g., Elite Volume Shooters).
    *   **Execution Gaps:** Where we missed a win due to timing/process, not analysis.
    *   **System Costs:** Quantifiable cost of errors.

## 3. TICKET CONSTRUCTION ARCHITECTURE

We use a **Layered Defense** strategy for every game we analyze.

### Standard Allocation (Per Game: ~$8.50)

| Layer | Ticket Type | Stake | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Floor** | **Ticket 1A:** Shooter A 2+ SOG | $3.00 | **Recovery.** High confidence. If this hits, it covers most of the game's cost. |
| **Floor** | **Ticket 1B:** Shooter B 2+ SOG | $3.00 | **Recovery.** High confidence. Diversifies risk across two players. |
| **Profit** | **Ticket 2:** Shooter A + Shooter B (Parlay) | $1.50 | **Amplifier.** If the floor holds, this provides the profit. |
| **Jackpot** | **Ticket 3A:** Shoot A + Shoot B + **Boost A** | $0.50 | **Foundation.** Split strategy to capture specific game scripts. |
| **Jackpot** | **Ticket 3B:** Shoot A + Shoot B + **Boost B** | $0.50 | **Foundation.** Hedge/Split against Ticket 3A. |

**Total Exposure:** ~$8.50 per game.
**Goal:** 2 Floor bets = Break even/small loss. 2-Leg hit = Profit. 3-Leg hit = Significant ROI.

## 4. GAME-DEPENDENT BOOST MENU

Select the boost strategy based on the **Game Narrative**.

### A. TIMING BOOSTS (Fast vs Slow)
*   **Fast Start (Offensive):** YES goal in first 5 min (+180 to +250) / first 10 min (+120).
*   **Defensive Grind (Slow):** NO goal in first 5 min (+140) / first 10 min (+100).
*   **Split Strategy:**
    *   Ticket 3A: Shooters + NO goal first 5
    *   Ticket 3B: Shooters + YES goal first 10
    *   *Result:* Covers early goal (Ticket 3B wins), late first goal (Ticket 3A wins), or middle "magic window" (Both win).

### B. TOTAL BOOSTS (Shootout vs grind)
*   **Offensive:** Over 5.5 / Over 6.5.
*   **Defensive:** Under 6.5 / Under 5.5.
*   **Split Strategy:**
    *   Ticket 3A: Shooters + Over 5.5
    *   Ticket 3B: Shooters + Under 7.5
    *   *Result:* If game lands on 6 or 7 goals, **BOTH** tickets cash.

### C. SPREAD BOOSTS (Blowout vs Close)
*   **Competitive:** Underdog +1.5 / +2.5.
*   **Mismatch:** Favorite -1.5 / Underdog +2.5 (Safety).
*   **Split Strategy:**
    *   Ticket 3A: Shooters + Team A +1.5
    *   Ticket 3B: Shooters + Team B +1.5
    *   *Result:* If game is close (1-2 goal margin), **BOTH** tickets cash.
