Acknowledged, Project Lead Bam082608. Directive received.

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: STRATEGIC GAPS IDENTIFIED

SITUATION: 10-game NHL slate presents statistical edge opportunity based on historical Black Friday (+108% ROI) and Thanksgiving (+575% ROI) performance data.

PROBLEM: Current gameplan lacks real-time verification of critical variables required for Protocol Addendum 2.7.1 compliance.

RECOMMENDATION: Execute phased intelligence gathering before capital deployment.

---

## PHASE 1: CRITICAL INTELLIGENCE GAPS (MUST RESOLVE)

GAP #1: TIER 1 STAR CURRENT PERFORMANCE VALIDATION

Required Data (Missing):
- Bedard: Confirmed playing, recent 2-goal game validated
- Robertson (DAL): Last 5 games SOG average UNVERIFIED
- Hintz (DAL): Last 5 games SOG average UNVERIFIED
- Ovechkin (WAS): Current season SOG average UNVERIFIED
- Matthews (TOR): Injury status UNVERIFIED

ACTION REQUIRED: Pull current season statistics for all Tier 1 candidates before bet placement.

GAP #2: OPPONENT DEFENSIVE RATING VALIDATION

Missing Analysis:
- NYR defensive SOG allowed/game
- VEG defensive SOG allowed/game
- LAK defensive SOG allowed/game
- FLA defensive SOG allowed/game

ACTION REQUIRED: Validate opponent defensive metrics support Tier 1 star prop thesis.

GAP #3: GOALTENDER CONFIRMATION

Missing Data:
- DAL @ NYR: Starting goalies UNCONFIRMED
- CHI @ VEG: Starting goalies UNCONFIRMED
- WAS @ LAK: Starting goalies UNCONFIRMED

ACTION REQUIRED: Verify starting goalies via DailyFaceoff.com before 6:00 PM lock window.

---

## PHASE 2: BANKROLL MANAGEMENT ANALYSIS

Current Bankroll: $582
Proposed Exposure: $50 (8.6%)
Kelly Criterion Calculation and Risk-Adjusted Kelly summarized.

FINDING: Proposed exposure is APPROVED from bankroll management perspective, with recommended conservative sizing at ~10% (Risk-adjusted Kelly) if assumptions hold.

---

## PHASE 3: BET STRUCTURE OPTIMIZATION

Proposed structure and per-game allocation are included. Priority allocation: DAL @ NYR, CHI @ VEG, WAS @ LAK. Conditional allocation for TOR @ FLA depending on Matthews injury status.

Cross-slate special and buffer recommendations included.

---

## PHASE 4: RISK MITIGATION PROTOCOL

Threat model with probabilities, impacts, and mitigations for:
- Tier 1 star underperformance
- Goaltender variance
- Defensive matchup surprise
- Late scratch / injury
- Tilt / emotional betting
