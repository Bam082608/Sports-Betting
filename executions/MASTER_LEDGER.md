## 📊 ENTRY 002: THE DISCIPLINE OF RECOVERY
**Date:** 2025-12-11
**Game:** NBA Slate (Celtics Loss / General NBA Loss)
**Outcome:** Loss avoided spiraling into tilt.
**Value of Discipline:** Preserved Bankroll ($600+) vs Potential Ruin.

### THE EVENT
Suffered a ~$50-80 setback on NBA bets (Celtics ML parlay). Instead of chasing losses with high-risk bets ("Tilt"), the response was a calculated, slow recovery plan.

### THE BREAKDOWN
- **The Impulse:** "Bet big to win it back fast." (Gambler Mentality)
- **The Action:** "Grind it back over 2-3 weeks with small, structured bets." (Sharp Mentality)
- **The Reality:** Bankroll is still up +1400% overall ($40 → $600). A $50 loss is a fluctuation, not a disaster.

### THE STRATEGIC LESSON
> "Recovery is a Grind, Not a Hail Mary."

The difference between a gambler and a sharp is how they handle the red days. Accepting the loss and reverting to the proven "Spider Web" process prevents one bad night from becoming a bad month.

### THE PROTOCOL UPDATE
**The Recovery Protocol:**
1.  **Acknowledge the loss without emotion.**
2.  **Do NOT increase unit size to "chase."**
3.  **Allocate a small, separate "Recovery Fund" (e.g., $15-20).**
4.  **Apply the core "Spider Web" strategy (small units, high volume, edges) to the recovery.**
5.  **Timeline:** Recover over weeks, not days.

## 📊 ENTRY 001: INFORMATION-JUSTIFIED MICRO-LAYERING
**Date:** 2025-12-06
**Game:** Colorado @ New York Rangers (Final: 14 goals)
**Outcome:** Over 8.5 HIT | Micro-Layer MISSED (Over 9.5/10.5)
**Cost of Regret:** ~$0.80 - $1.20 (estimated payout foregone)

### THE EVENT
A "compression event" where pre-game analysis correctly identified a nuclear high-event game script (COL @ NYR), but betting structure failed to capitalize on the extreme outliers (9.5 and 10.5 goals) due to conservative "standard night" logic.

### THE BREAKDOWN
- **The Win:** Correctly bet Over 8.5 based on "High-Event Inevitable" analysis.
- **The Miss:** Failed to layer $0.10 micro-bets on Over 9.5 and 10.5.
- **The Reality:** Game finished with 14 goals. Both moonshots would have cashed at 4x-6x odds.

### THE STRATEGIC LESSON
> "Information-Driven Micro-Layering ≠ Blind Lottery Tickets"

When information explicitly indicates a "High-Event Inevitable" script (Top 10 Offenses + Porous D + Elite Stars), the probability of extreme outliers (9.5+) shifts from "lottery" to "+EV Micro-Layer."

### THE PROTOCOL UPDATE
**Effective Immediately:**
When a game is identified as **HIGH-EVENT INEVITABLE**:
1.  **Core Bet:** Place Standard Unit on Over 8.5.
2.  **Micro-Layer:** Place 0.2u split ($0.10 each) on Over 9.5 and Over 10.5.

**Result:** Converts "good nights" (winning the Over 8.5) into "great nights" (sweeping the board) with negligible additional risk ($0.20).
