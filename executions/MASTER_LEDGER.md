## 📊 ENTRY 001: INFORMATION-JUSTIFIED MICRO-LAYERING
**Date:** 2025-12-06
**Game:** Colorado @ New York Rangers (Final: 14 goals)
**Outcome:** Over 8.5 HIT | Micro-Layer MISSED (Over 9.5/10.5)
**Cost of Regret:** ~$0.80 - $1.20 (estimated payout foregone)

### THE EVENT
A "compression event" where pre-game analysis correctly identified a nuclear high-event game script (COL @ NYR), but betting structure failed to capitalize on the extreme outliers (9.5 and 10.5 goals) due to conservative "standard night" logic.

### THE BREAKDOWN
- **The Win:** Correctly bet Over 8.5 based on "High-Event Inevitable" analysis.
- **The Miss:** Failed to layer $0.10 micro-bets on Over 9.5 and 10.5.
- **The Reality:** Game finished with 14 goals. Both moonshots would have cashed at 4x-6x odds.

### THE STRATEGIC LESSON
> "Information-Driven Micro-Layering ≠ Blind Lottery Tickets"

When information explicitly indicates a "High-Event Inevitable" script (Top 10 Offenses + Porous D + Elite Stars), the probability of extreme outliers (9.5+) shifts from "lottery" to "+EV Micro-Layer."

### THE PROTOCOL UPDATE
**Effective Immediately:**
When a game is identified as **HIGH-EVENT INEVITABLE**:
1.  **Core Bet:** Place Standard Unit on Over 8.5.
2.  **Micro-Layer:** Place 0.2u split ($0.10 each) on Over 9.5 and Over 10.5.

**Result:** Converts "good nights" (winning the Over 8.5) into "great nights" (sweeping the board) with negligible additional risk ($0.20).
